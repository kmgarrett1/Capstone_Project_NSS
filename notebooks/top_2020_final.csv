Mask requirements for staff, but none for students. Parents are rejoicing and talking about the relief of “not having to homeschool” their kids come fall. 

Listen here: I’m a teacher and a mother. Something that annoys the shit out of me was the amount of parents on social media who were complaining about how much time they spent “homeschooling” their child during quarantine and how they deserve my salary for doing “all the work.”

Unless you are part of an accredited homeschooling program, were creating the curriculum, coming up with the assignments, and/or actively engaging and developing lesson plans, you were, in fact, not homeschooling. I’m a teacher, but I didn’t homeschool my child. The teacher who made the lessons and created learning opportunities is the one who taught my child. 

Did some of you complete your kid’s homework for them and then bitch and moan about how hard homeschooling is? ABSOLUTELY. But was that your job? NO. 

Was it your job to check in with your kids and make sure things were going okay? Sure. But that’s always your job as a parent. It’s literally the bare minimum.

Schools are really good at making things  look good on PAPER, but they cut corners in reality. I’m sure you can think of plenty of instances. 

WHEN you see safety measures being neglected, document it. Share it. 

If they’re telling you they’ll keep you safe... 

#hold them accountable for it.

When they delete your account, you'll lose your work if you haven't archived it elsewhere.

I know of two ways to do this archiving. If you put the stuff you want to save in a folder on your school account Drive, you can download it as a zip archive (see context menu on the folder itself). If you're worried about formatting issues going from the Google to the desktop versions of files (and possibly back again), there's an alternative that's a little more laborious.

[See edit at bottom before you try my inferior process, preserved for posterity]

Just sharing a file or a folder to a personal Google account isn't enough. When the original owner account is deleted, your files will go as well. It might be possible for you to switch the ""owner"" account for a file (in the sharing settings), but your school might not permit switching to an account outside its own domain.

So! How to migrate files from your old school Google Drive to your personal Google Drive?

1. Put the files you want in a folder.
2. Save a zip archive if you didn't already, just in case.
3. Share the folder with your personal Google account.
4. Open the folder from your personal account.
5. Make a copy of every file in the folder. This can be done in bulk but it can get time consuming. If you have hundreds of files, prepare for some frustration. Think of a way to chunk 'em.
6. The copies now belong to your personal account. Put them in a folder that belongs to your personal account.

I'll stress again, don't wait on this. I started the process with the zip archives weeks ago and some of the Google to Google transferring that I just described, but not all. This morning I discovered that my school account has been turned off, so I had to use the zip archive for the rest.

If anybody has a tried-and-true method that's better than what I've described, let's hear about it!

When they delete your account, you'll lose your work if you haven't archived it elsewhere.

I know of two ways to do this archiving. If you put the stuff you want to save in a folder on your school account Drive, you can download it as a zip archive (see context menu on the folder itself). If you're worried about formatting issues going from the Google to the desktop versions of files (and possibly back again), there's an alternative that's a little more laborious.

[See edit at bottom before you try my inferior process, preserved for posterity]

Just sharing a file or a folder to a personal Google account isn't enough. When the original owner account is deleted, your files will go as well. It might be possible for you to switch the ""owner"" account for a file (in the sharing settings), but your school might not permit switching to an account outside its own domain.

So! How to migrate files from your old school Google Drive to your personal Google Drive?

1. Put the files you want in a folder.
2. Save a zip archive if you didn't already, just in case.
3. Share the folder with your personal Google account.
4. Open the folder from your personal account.
5. Make a copy of every file in the folder. This can be done in bulk but it can get time consuming. If you have hundreds of files, prepare for some frustration. Think of a way to chunk 'em.
6. The copies now belong to your personal account. Put them in a folder that belongs to your personal account.

I'll stress again, don't wait on this. I started the process with the zip archives weeks ago and some of the Google to Google transferring that I just described, but not all. This morning I discovered that my school account has been turned off, so I had to use the zip archive for the rest.

If anybody has a tried-and-true method that's better than what I've described, let's hear about it!

At the end of the school year, some of my kids are still on beginning kindergarten level and can barely read. All year I have been fighting with my team leader and admin about actually being honest about the fact that they are not meeting promotion criteria. We just did quarter 3 report cards and I was brutally honest and marked down on every single one (except one child) that they are not meeting promotion criteria. These kids can't go to second grade barely reading CVC words, knowing 12 sight words, and retaining no strategies for reading! I was just told that I have to erase all of it except for the parents who have specifically expressed that they want their child to stay back. I was told that if I say that they're not meeting promotion criteria that I then will have to go through the ""headache"" of proving to the parent that I'm not lying. Well guess what, I CAN PROVE TO THE PARENT I'M NOT LYING.

Admin is quoted as saying ""We can't retain everyone who needs to be retained. It doesn't look good on us as a school."" So that means we need to run in the opposite direction and not retain anyone?

At the end of the school year, some of my kids are still on beginning kindergarten level and can barely read. All year I have been fighting with my team leader and admin about actually being honest about the fact that they are not meeting promotion criteria. We just did quarter 3 report cards and I was brutally honest and marked down on every single one (except one child) that they are not meeting promotion criteria. These kids can't go to second grade barely reading CVC words, knowing 12 sight words, and retaining no strategies for reading! I was just told that I have to erase all of it except for the parents who have specifically expressed that they want their child to stay back. I was told that if I say that they're not meeting promotion criteria that I then will have to go through the ""headache"" of proving to the parent that I'm not lying. Well guess what, I CAN PROVE TO THE PARENT I'M NOT LYING.

Admin is quoted as saying ""We can't retain everyone who needs to be retained. It doesn't look good on us as a school."" So that means we need to run in the opposite direction and not retain anyone?

When my wife (also a teacher in my district) told me that the plan was for regular classroom teachers to simultaneously serve both students who were choosing to stay home and students who were choosing to attend class, I didn't actually believe it.  That's how ridiculous and wild that suggestion was to me.

But, it is now clear to me that this isn't just the plan in my district, but in districts around the country.  And it's ridiculous.

My plan remains to structure my classes as though all students are doing them 100% virtually.  Then, when and if students do attend in-person class, they'll just have access to me for in-person help, conversation, and discussions.

In my mind the ""online option"" would have been an expanded virtual academy with dedicated and qualified online teachers.  Or, at worst, simply enrolling kids in our online credit recovery system.

When my wife (also a teacher in my district) told me that the plan was for regular classroom teachers to simultaneously serve both students who were choosing to stay home and students who were choosing to attend class, I didn't actually believe it.  That's how ridiculous and wild that suggestion was to me.

But, it is now clear to me that this isn't just the plan in my district, but in districts around the country.  And it's ridiculous.

My plan remains to structure my classes as though all students are doing them 100% virtually.  Then, when and if students do attend in-person class, they'll just have access to me for in-person help, conversation, and discussions.  

I'd invite anyone who thinks they may be able to adopt this model for this school year to join me.  Otherwise, I think you're going to literally end up doing double work.  And, while I'm down to 3 preps this year (from 4 the past three years), that's still wayyyy too many for me to consider doing double work.   Maybe those single prep teachers out there will be fine just teaching two concurrent versions of their course.  That model will not work for me.",43,compound,0.9186,2020

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job. And that's low-balling it because 10 ""extra"" days would be like an extra 30 minutes a day which is definitely a low-ball number. I'd say I spend *at least* 45 min-1 hour on average.

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job. And that's low-balling it because 10 ""extra"" days would be like an extra 30 minutes a day which is definitely a low-ball number. I'd say I spend *at least* 45 min-1 hour on average. Some days I leave when the kids do. Other days I'm there latte.

I work in a small school in a small town. My school has about 300 kids.

Today two parents walked in for an IEP meeting. Unmasked. Our principal came out and told them they would need to wear a mask. Immediately the mom put hers on, but the dad said “no. I’m not going to do that. This is silly.” And walked out. I couldn’t tell if mom looked annoyed with our principal or embarrassed of her husband.

I work in a small school in a small town. My school has about 300 kids.

Today two parents walked in for an IEP meeting. Unmasked. Our principal came out and told them they would need to wear a mask. Immediately the mom put hers on, but the dad said “no. I’m not going to do that. This is silly.” And walked out. I couldn’t tell if mom looked annoyed with our principal or embarrassed of her husband.

I'm 17 years old, and ever since I was in middle school I have wanted to be a teacher. Though I (obviously) have no experience in teaching yet, I find the field fascinating and I really want to be a teacher. I just applied to a lot of colleges, praying that I get into my top choice lol.

But anyway, the main point of this post is as follows - I am non-binary, and I go by they/them pronouns. I plan on teaching high school (or middle school, but preferably high school) and I just was hoping for any non-binary (or LGBTQ+) teachers to chime in and offer their true opinion on what it's like to teach when you're openly queer. If you're not LGBTQ+ but know a teacher who is, I'd also appreciate that too. I'm looking for any advice here, lol.

In my ideal world, I'd be called Teacher \[Name\] rather than Miss/Mister. I understand that not every student or coworker will respect it or be open to the idea, but I just want to know if this is a realistic option for me. I always thought that I couldn't be a teacher because I'm trans, until I saw someone online who was also non-binary and a teacher. It gave me a lot of hope, and I literally would not be even considering teaching anymore if it weren't for them, since I used to think that being a non-binary teacher was unrealistic. I'm hoping that someone here can provide some realistic insight to what it would be like to teach as a non-binary person.

Once I finish college, I plan on moving to an area with a large queer population/acceptance - I'd imagine that it would be kinder to live there, though I suppose it could be difficult to even find such a place, unfortunately.

Anyway, this post is a whole jumble of emotions and thoughts. I just really, *really*, want this to work out. I honestly could not think of a career that I would be happier with, despite all the negativity I see here.

Any advice is good advice, thank you all so much!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I have recieved SO MUCH LOVE and support from everyone here. Only one super transphobic comment that got removed! I hope that guy sees this edit. I feel WAY more comfortable and excited to start teaching. I still have a long way to go, but these comments changed me in an indescribable way. I honestly thought there weren't many queer teachers out there, because I had never seen any. But now I'm reading all these comments that are from other queer teachers telling me their experiences. I am so thankful and happy. You guys are awesome.

A lot of you commented that there needs to be more queer representation in education - and I definitely agree. The most representation I've seen in a classroom is a pride flag during my freshman year and a teacher that was rumored to be gay before he quit. I realized tonight that I wanted to be that representation for someone - even if it's just a single student. I want to be the person who makes some queer kid go ""wait, I can do that?""

Thank you all for the kind comments. I know it won't be all great, but I am definitely happy with my career choice now. Praying that my true experience will be equally as exciting.

So, All morning I have been on interview zoom calls with my principal and two other colleagues. I’m doing them in the basement because my fiancé is also working from home upstairs. I’m on the call and my one cat, Boba, starts to scratch at my leg. So I casually pick him up out of the video and move him.

This would have been fine, except due to severe storms, I had some water under the window. Well he didn’t like that and jumped ON TOP OF MY HEAD. He knocked my glasses off. I was humiliated but couldn’t stop laughing. Everyone in the interview was laughing but I felt so bad. Anyway, I apologized after the interview because I was still embarrassed.

This weekend we were spent money we don't have on plexiglass desk shields and an N95 cartridge system for a large respirator I bought for her. We also found protective goggles that she can comfortably nwear all day since the viral load is going to be off the charts in there, and it can enter your system through the eyes. We also filled out a will and took out extra life insurance. We had a serious discussion on what to do if one of us dies, and filled out planning for last wishes.

I had to excuse myself and cry in the bathroom. The thought of being without her and not having the chance to raise our own babies gutted me. She's my entire universe and weve worked so hard, hand in hand, to get where we are.

 I put together an in-depth vulnerability assessment for the school system highlighting what communities are going to get nailed the hardest, and why they need to hold off on in-person instruction for the first grading period.

2. with the n95, also wear a face shield.
3. wear mask in a high bun and cover hair because droplets can rest in hair and then spread if touched.

They generally think that teachers are overpaid because of all the time off, and that our job is easy. After I got my first teaching job, my sister in law decided to go back to school (she has an associates degree) to become a teacher too, because our schedule is so great, and she loves kids, so she wants to teach kindergarten since that’s, in her words, the easy stuff. (I teach high school English, but my own kids are in kindergarten and I know she’s so off base here!)

Except she can’t pass the Basic Skills test to enter the program. She’s failed it four times now. This is not surprising to me - she struggles with school, pressures me to practically write her essays for her, and she is a super permissive parent, so her own kids regularly have big behavioral problems. She and my mother in law are astounded that she can’t pass this test. They rant about how teaching is so easy, any idiot could do it, the test is so pointless, she’s definitely smarter than other people she knows who have passed it (my mother in law side eyes me while saying this), etc. (As an aside, I know the test has its issues, but in this case I think it’s doing its job - preventing a bad candidate from becoming a teacher. She’s the kind of parent where her 9 year old son attacked a preschooler because he doesn’t like how they looked, and she just pulled him off and said, “You need to stop!

They generally think that teachers are overpaid because of all the time off, and that our job is easy. After I got my first teaching job, my sister in law decided to go back to school (she has an associates degree) to become a teacher too, because our schedule is so great, and she loves kids, so she wants to teach kindergarten since that’s, in her words, the easy stuff. (I teach high school English, but my own kids are in kindergarten and I know she’s so off base here!)

Except she can’t pass the Basic Skills test to enter the program. She’s failed it four times now. This is not surprising to me - she struggles with school, pressures me to practically write her essays for her, and she is a super permissive parent, so her own kids regularly have big behavioral problems. She and my mother in law are astounded that she can’t pass this test. They rant about how teaching is so easy, any idiot could do it, the test is so pointless, she’s definitely smarter than other people she knows who have passed it (my mother in law side eyes me while saying this), etc. (As an aside, I know the test has its issues, but in this case I think it’s doing its job - preventing a bad candidate from becoming a teacher. She’s the kind of parent where her 9 year old son attacked a preschooler because he doesn’t like how they looked, and she just pulled him off and said, “You need to stop! Go watch YouTube or something!” before offering a halfhearted apology and walking away.)

When they delete your account, you'll lose your work if you haven't archived it elsewhere.

I know of two ways to do this archiving. If you put the stuff you want to save in a folder on your school account Drive, you can download it as a zip archive (see context menu on the folder itself). If you're worried about formatting issues going from the Google to the desktop versions of files (and possibly back again), there's an alternative that's a little more laborious.

Just sharing a file or a folder to a personal Google account isn't enough. When the original owner account is deleted, your files will go as well. It might be possible for you to switch the ""owner"" account for a file (in the sharing settings), but your school might not permit switching to an account outside its own domain.

So! How to migrate files from your old school Google Drive to your personal Google Drive?

1. Put the files you want in a folder.
2. Save a zip archive if you didn't already, just in case.
3. Share the folder with your personal Google account.
4. Open the folder from your personal account.
5. Make a copy of every file in the folder. This can be done in bulk but it can get time consuming. If you have hundreds of files, prepare for some frustration. Think of a way to chunk 'em.
6. The copies now belong to your personal account. Put them in a folder that belongs to your personal account.

I'll stress again, don't wait on this. I started the process with the zip archives weeks ago and some of the Google to Google transferring that I just described, but not all. This morning I discovered that my school account has been turned off, so I had to use the zip archive for the rest.

I'm dead to the world. I neglect friendships, my health, and my household cleaning. I have a much better work/life balance than I did last year, but I still recognize how unhealthy I am during the school year.

So, I'm wondering a few things:

* Are there any teachers out there who are in this situation? How do you deal?
* Are there any teachers who have found ways to manage the draining feeling after returning home?
* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job.

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job. And that's low-balling it because 10 ""extra"" days would be like an extra 30 minutes a day which is definitely a low-ball number. I'd say I spend *at least* 45 min-1 hour on average. Some days I leave when the kids do. Other days I'm there latte.

I feel we cannot teach if we aren’t in session because there are too many variables - i.e. kids having shoddy internet connection; families with multiple children in multiple grade levels; families with no computer in the house; students with special needs not getting the accommodations they need; students whose parents are still at work all day and are thus not available from 8-5 to help them log onto livestream classes or help with homework; kids who have a terrible environment at home and school is their only refuge.... I’m sure the list goes on for some of you who have read this far.

The amount of stress we’re going through outweighs the amount of actual learning that’s taking place. 

I feel we cannot teach if we aren’t in session because there are too many variables - i.e. kids having shoddy internet connection; families with multiple children in multiple grade levels; families with no computer in the house; students with special needs not getting the accommodations they need; students whose parents are still at work all day and are thus not available from 8-5 to help them log onto livestream classes or help with homework; kids who have a terrible environment at home and school is their only refuge....

You have to speak up because no one listens to the school nurse and most administrators are useless. The petty kings among you are going to kill us all.",148,compound,-0.9632,2020

After not hearing from him or his parents since school shut down about a month ago, he finally reached out to me. It wasn’t about online content or even anything school related. In fact it was simply an email titled “My Dog” with a picture of his pup under some blankets.

He was by far not one of the “popular” kids, because he was different in the eyes of the other students. He has a mild form of autism which affects his social skills. Needless to say, he was one of the smartest most curious students I had. He was one of the few that genuinely brought a smile to my face every day. After not hearing from him or his parents since school shut down about a month ago, he finally reached out to me. It wasn’t about online content or even anything school related. In fact it was simply an email titled “My Dog” with a picture of his pup under some blankets.

I teach in a fantastic district who has now made masks part of the dress code (they're now mandated in CO in public places). We've even used funding that was supposed to go to new additions on schools to start an online program for those rightfully opting out of coming back. My school's administration is great and I know they will take care of us to the best of their abilities. But I've never been so scared in my life.

I just wanted to start a discussion based on an observation from my own district and something I've been seeing others posting about. As expected, a shit ton of teaching positions are opening up. We get at least five a day now in our emails (they go to everybody in the district). Do you think that yet another possible outcome against opening will be simply that there aren't enough teachers to fill the spots? I can't imagine anybody right now who would get into the job right now. What are your thoughts? Everything is only going to get worse as time's arrow marches closer and closer. 

I teach in a fantastic district who has now made masks part of the dress code (they're now mandated in CO in public places). We've even used funding that was supposed to go to new additions on schools to start an online program for those rightfully opting out of coming back. My school's administration is great and I know they will take care of us to the best of their abilities. But I've never been so scared in my life. My heart breaks when I read about people's districts not believing in this shit, not requiring their students to wear masks.

* We are ~~going hybrid~~  opening normally and one confirmed case in a school could shut it down.

* We have 4700 students and 775 staff =  5475 people in the school system.
* We have a recent exponential rise and 100 confirmed cases in the county in the past 7 days. (picking this number because it would mean anyone who tested positive in the past 7 days could not go to school still and is likely still positive...)

This means that even if those 9 people stay home it is still likely there are 9 more going to the school infected.

This means that, using these numbers, there will very likely be positive cases immediately upon opening. *This is if our new case rate stays the same or rises.* (Or even lowers a bit, technically).

When they delete your account, you'll lose your work if you haven't archived it elsewhere.

I know of two ways to do this archiving. If you put the stuff you want to save in a folder on your school account Drive, you can download it as a zip archive (see context menu on the folder itself). If you're worried about formatting issues going from the Google to the desktop versions of files (and possibly back again), there's an alternative that's a little more laborious.

[See edit at bottom before you try my inferior process, preserved for posterity]

Just sharing a file or a folder to a personal Google account isn't enough. When the original owner account is deleted, your files will go as well. It might be possible for you to switch the ""owner"" account for a file (in the sharing settings), but your school might not permit switching to an account outside its own domain.

So! How to migrate files from your old school Google Drive to your personal Google Drive?

1. Put the files you want in a folder.
2. Save a zip archive if you didn't already, just in case.
3. Share the folder with your personal Google account.
4. Open the folder from your personal account.
5. Make a copy of every file in the folder. This can be done in bulk but it can get time consuming. If you have hundreds of files, prepare for some frustration. Think of a way to chunk 'em.
6. The copies now belong to your personal account. Put them in a folder that belongs to your personal account.

I'll stress again, don't wait on this. I started the process with the zip archives weeks ago and some of the Google to Google transferring that I just described, but not all. This morning I discovered that my school account has been turned off, so I had to use the zip archive for the rest.

* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job. And that's low-balling it because 10 ""extra"" days would be like an extra 30 minutes a day which is definitely a low-ball number. I'd say I spend *at least* 45 min-1 hour on average. Some days I leave when the kids do. Other days I'm there latte.

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

He was by far not one of the “popular” kids, because he was different in the eyes of the other students. He has a mild form of autism which affects his social skills. Needless to say, he was one of the smartest most curious students I had. He was one of the few that genuinely brought a smile to my face every day. After not hearing from him or his parents since school shut down about a month ago, he finally reached out to me. It wasn’t about online content or even anything school related.

This isn't about students who are living in NYC, or LA, or any other hot spot, in which dozens/scores of people are dying every day. I understand that.

This isn't about districts with high levels of poverty, where students don't have access to devices and the internet.

This isn't about students who come from abusive homes and now have to live in constant fear of being beaten, or screamed at for any little thing.

This isn't about the students who now have to spend their waking hours taking care of their young siblings, while their parents work, and in lieu of daycares and grade schools that are now closed.

I've got plenty of sympathy for those kids.

But for a lot of areas around the United States, and for a lot of districts (like mine) that don't have a ton of poverty, where the virus is fairly controlled, where an overwhelming majority of students have devices (school-issued) and access to the internet.... Are we really asking too much by expecting them to spend an hour or two per day (on average) on school work? I'm all about leniency -and I've already extended significant grace to students- but what I've discovered in all of this is that the students are, essentially, who we thought they were. The lazy kids are lazy. The hard workers are hard workers. And now I'm essentially supposed to give Billy a 'pass' even though he's got a solid home life, access to wifi, and parents who still have jobs/paychecks? I'm sorry. But Billy's just lazy. He doesn't have siblings to take care of. He doesn't have sick family members. He's sitting on his ass all day, playing video games and watching Netflix.

I know this makes me sound like a real shitheal, but MAN. I've gone out of my way to design some curriculum that I think is pretty damn accessible and easy to follow and some of these kids (who don't have excuses... not the ones who do have valid excuses) just don't put in any work at all. They've figured it out that none of this matters and have decided to completely mail it in. I guess what I'm really upset about is that it makes me feel like the asshole for having higher expectations. And if it truly doesn't even matter, then what are we doing? Let's all just mail it in for the next 'x' month(s).

In an effort to reduce commonly repeated and/or neglected/overlooked threads, we have created a mega-thread for all COVID-19/Corona virus-related posts.

We will not forbid the use or discussion of COVID-19 that are incidentally related to COVID outside of this thread, but **posts primarily focused on or directly related to COVID-19 that are posted outside of this thread will be deleted and/or its author will be fed to the woodchuck in my backyard.** 

Two questions to ask yourself are ""am I only asking this because of the pandemic,"" and ""am I looking for a different answer than normal BECAUSE of COVID?""  If you answered yes to either, the post is not incidentally related and should be posted here.

Please consider where your topic falls under these categories:

-End of Year 2019-2020 &amp; Summer 2020

-Beginning of Year 20-21 and Return to School

-Job Search and Non-renewals/RIFs

-New Teachers (with secured positions)

-Preservice Teachers (education majors, field experience students, student teachers)

-Career Changes Within/Entering Education

-Career Changes/Consideration from Education

-Miscellaneous COVID-19 Info Relevant to This Sub

**Please DO NOT make your own comment.  Instead, comment under my parent comments from the categories listed above.**  If you make a comment outside of the parent comments I have created, your post will be removed.

Note:  threads like this often lose traction quickly.  We plan to keep this thread up until July 1, so information remains current.",263,compound,0.9573,2020

* Are there any teachers who have found ways to manage the draining feeling after returning home?
* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job. And that's low-balling it because 10 ""extra"" days would be like an extra 30 minutes a day which is definitely a low-ball number. I'd say I spend *at least* 45 min-1 hour on average. Some days I leave when the kids do. Other days I'm there latte.

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

This isn't about students who are living in NYC, or LA, or any other hot spot, in which dozens/scores of people are dying every day. I understand that.

This isn't about the students who now have to spend their waking hours taking care of their young siblings, while their parents work, and in lieu of daycares and grade schools that are now closed.

I've got plenty of sympathy for those kids.

Are we really asking too much by expecting them to spend an hour or two per day (on average) on school work?

We had to do that a couple times but as most of them got it, they left the chat and I was left with about 13 that were still having trouble.

I used outlook to invite all 271 of my kids to a teams meeting set for today at 10:30 and had a lot of kids accepting immediately and all the way up to the time of the class. 


Today I had 60 (6x as much as other teachers on my team) kids in the voice chat on teams. I let them talk for a bit and we caught up, then I muted everyone and walked them through how to get to the assignment. We had to do that a couple times but as most of them got it, they left the chat and I was left with about 13 that were still having trouble. I told them if they couldnt download the story to email me directly and I would send it.

But damnit I still work hard. 

I shared an education meme on my Facebook page - basically a gif of someone doing random tasks/looking confused with the caption “when you’ve had 3 weeks off of work and forget how to do your job”.  It was funny, lots of people liked/shared it, but I got one comment that really just hurt my heart and my pride...

“funny, but aren’t you just a teachers aide?”

Now the person who commented is a vaguely known acquaintance (one of those, we met a handful of times in back college so we added each other on Facebook type of friend). They work in a field totally unrelated to education and they are one of those very opinionated types that see the world in extremes.

I stared at the comment for awhile before I cried a bit. Somehow a few simple words from someone who doesn’t even matter was able to cut to my heart and bring some old insecurities to the surface.

I went to college for education, but chose to just get an associates, not my bachelors, because I didn’t want to put myself in massive amounts of debt. My family judged me for it but I knew for my mental health and financial well being, that was the best choice for me.

Fast forward 5 years and I LOVE what I do. I wake up everyday excited to go work, excited to see my students, to work with the classroom teacher, and to be whatever the class needs me to be.


The teacher is having a rough time with a student? No problem! I’ll switch roles with her and lead the lesson while she helps that child.

A child is struggling with certain letters? I got this! Let’s work on this together and find the best way to learn.

But damnit I still work hard. 

I shared an education meme on my Facebook page - basically a gif of someone doing random tasks/looking confused with the caption “when you’ve had 3 weeks off of work and forget how to do your job”.  It was funny, lots of people liked/shared it, but I got one comment that really just hurt my heart and my pride...

“funny, but aren’t you just a teachers aide?”

Now the person who commented is a vaguely known acquaintance (one of those, we met a handful of times in back college so we added each other on Facebook type of friend). They work in a field totally unrelated to education and they are one of those very opinionated types that see the world in extremes.

I stared at the comment for awhile before I cried a bit. Somehow a few simple words from someone who doesn’t even matter was able to cut to my heart and bring some old insecurities to the surface.

I went to college for education, but chose to just get an associates, not my bachelors, because I didn’t want to put myself in massive amounts of debt. My family judged me for it but I knew for my mental health and financial well being, that was the best choice for me.

Fast forward 5 years and I LOVE what I do. I wake up everyday excited to go work, excited to see my students, to work with the classroom teacher, and to be whatever the class needs me to be.


The teacher is having a rough time with a student? No problem! I’ll switch roles with her and lead the lesson while she helps that child.

A child is struggling with certain letters? I got this! Let’s work on this together and find the best way to learn.

Student,

I'm sorry you're having trouble with Geometry.  As always, you can email me during my daily office hours.  Just as a reminder, you should be watching the YouTube videos I have posted for each section and working through the suggested practice problems and the worksheet.  Ask questions if you are having trouble understanding the material, but just as a reminder, the suggested problems and the worksheet are not graded - they are there for you to practice.  You should also be taking the assessments I have posted on WeBWork; not only will you be graded on these, but since you have unlimited attempts, it is also a way for you to self-assess on the material.

I know this is frustrating, but I'm here to help.

I'm dead to the world. I neglect friendships, my health, and my household cleaning. I have a much better work/life balance than I did last year, but I still recognize how unhealthy I am during the school year.

So, I'm wondering a few things:

* Are there any teachers out there who are in this situation? How do you deal?
* Are there any teachers who have found ways to manage the draining feeling after returning home?
* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

In just my first year of teaching it's not out of this world to imagine that I spent an extra (on average) 2.5 hours per day on my class. Sometimes more, sometimes less...but that's why it's an average. And I'm sure some people still spend extra time (I'm certain of it).

Let's say I worked 170 days my first year (bad weather, school out, etc). That's 170 x 2.5 hours=425 hours of extra time spent...time I don't get paid for (working outside of contract hours).

&amp;#x200B;

Now a normal ""contract hour only"" day would be 7:45 am - 3:45 pm = 8 hours contract time

&amp;#x200B;

So 425 hours / 8 hours = \~53 extra contract days spent

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my first year. I'm sure I spend an extra 20-30 contract days every year following that as well, but let's just focus on the 53 days.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been out (like a lot) since March 13. I had 9 weeks from that point (excluding Spring Break) until the end of the year.

9 weeks \* 5 school days = 45 contract days

&amp;#x200B;

I think of this digital learning, which is less demanding then face-to-face, as ""back-pay"" for all of the extra time I **HAVE** to spend for my class. All that time grading? Running copies? Communicating with parents? All of that time spent outside of ""contract hours""...which I don't get paid for...is being paid back here.

So please don't feel guilty if you are still getting paid. I continue to work my ass off for my students, but now it's a little simpler because I am having an easy time with the digital learning setup. I know some people aren't. Hell...some people aren't having to do anything (their year already ended somehow?). Don't feel guilty.

Trust me...you have already worked these hours probably several times over.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I've been at this for 8 years. Let's be GENEROUS and say that it was 53 days my first year and then 10 days each year following. So 53+70=123 extra contract days spent. I've spent nearly an entire school year of extra time **that I do not get paid for** just to be able to do my job. And that's low-balling it because 10 ""extra"" days would be like an extra 30 minutes a day which is definitely a low-ball number. I'd say I spend *at least* 45 min-1 hour on average. Some days I leave when the kids do. Other days I'm there latte.

“ Luckily fundamental roles of teacher is not to deliver information, it is to guide the social process of learning. The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite the students to want to learn
Yes they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point the most important  a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important , to make them feel accountable for doing the learing.”

This isn't about students who are living in NYC, or LA, or any other hot spot, in which dozens/scores of people are dying every day. I understand that.

This isn't about districts with high levels of poverty, where students don't have access to devices and the internet.

This isn't about students who come from abusive homes and now have to live in constant fear of being beaten, or screamed at for any little thing.

This isn't about the students who now have to spend their waking hours taking care of their young siblings, while their parents work, and in lieu of daycares and grade schools that are now closed.

I've got plenty of sympathy for those kids.

But for a lot of areas around the United States, and for a lot of districts (like mine) that don't have a ton of poverty, where the virus is fairly controlled, where an overwhelming majority of students have devices (school-issued) and access to the internet.... Are we really asking too much by expecting them to spend an hour or two per day (on average) on school work? I'm all about leniency -and I've already extended significant grace to students- but what I've discovered in all of this is that the students are, essentially, who we thought they were. The lazy kids are lazy. The hard workers are hard workers. And now I'm essentially supposed to give Billy a 'pass' even though he's got a solid home life, access to wifi, and parents who still have jobs/paychecks? I'm sorry. But Billy's just lazy. He doesn't have siblings to take care of. He doesn't have sick family members. He's sitting on his ass all day, playing video games and watching Netflix.

I know this makes me sound like a real shitheal, but MAN. I've gone out of my way to design some curriculum that I think is pretty damn accessible and easy to follow and some of these kids (who don't have excuses... not the ones who do have valid excuses) just don't put in any work at all. They've figured it out that none of this matters and have decided to completely mail it in. I guess what I'm really upset about is that it makes me feel like the asshole for having higher expectations. And if it truly doesn't even matter, then what are we doing?

Conducting online classes has been such a pain and so weird for a first-year teacher who was *just* getting the hang of it before the pandemic. I just had to share how sweet it was to see my kiddos, especially the seniors, who I may not see before they graduate high school if we don’t come back to the physical school this year. I don’t think we will.

I hope everyone is doing well and hanging in there! If you’ve done any fun things or had any sweet interactions, let me know!",432,compound,0.9695,2020

I am 100% empathetic to the plight of teachers. I have written much about education, and you should know I actually wanted to die when I first started teaching:

In fact, I tell my students all about gratitude. And I still do online. Here is why we should be thankful.

**Gratitude**

1) We are still getting paid: How many businesses are being shut down? It will only get worse. At least we have some security for the rest of the year.

2) We are not in the frontlines: My husband works in healthcare. Who knows what will happen? I pray every day for him.

3) We can breathe: Look, online learning can be stressful but most of us are benefiting. We are less stressed. Some are losing weight. Some of us are cleaning the things we never cleaned before. For teachers, this is not exactly a disaster.

4) We can learn new things: How many times have we criticized our students for not wanting to learn? We need to change our attitudes here.

5) We can show the truth: How many times do parents/society not believe us about students? Well, things may change a little here. I have seen more ""teacher appreciation"" memes in one month than I have in my lifetime.

If someone sees a ""lazy"" teacher during this time, that looks bad. Give it your all.

So what? 2 kids participate. Give those kids what they need.

6) Revolution: Parent/teacher relationships are generally weak. Let us work on changing this. Could we bring a revolution here?

**Conclusion**

Online learning is frustrating, but there is something called gratitude. We have no idea what can happen tomorrow.

I understand that different districts have varying levels of online availability. 

I understand many are frustrated.

Post winter break I decided to focus more on me, than on school. I started working out half an hour each morning, I have started small acts of mindfulness, I do meal planing so I know when I’m eating and what I’m eating, and in general when at school I try not to focus on results as much, but instead focus on staying calm and relaxed, rather than frantic and high strain like I was daily before break.

Wouldn’t you believe it, focusing more on my mental health makes me feel better, and makes me love my job more, and makes me a better teacher. I’ve heard it a thousand times that you need to make time for yourself as a teacher or else you’ll get burnt out fast, but for some reason I always thought “okay, but that will never work for me, I don’t have that kind of time.” Well I prioritized and made time, and now crazy enough my schoolwork goes quicker so I have MORE time on my hands. I’m honestly shocked at this turnaround because before break I felt exhausted daily, my lessons were awful, and I didn’t know if I was gonna make it through the year.

It made life harder at school, which in turn made me feel worse, and made it harder to even attempt to break those habits.

Post winter break I decided to focus more on me, than on school. I started working out half an hour each morning, I have started small acts of mindfulness, I do meal planing so I know when I’m eating and what I’m eating, and in general when at school I try not to focus on results as much, but instead focus on staying calm and relaxed, rather than frantic and high strain like I was daily before break.

Wouldn’t you believe it, focusing more on my mental health makes me feel better, and makes me love my job more, and makes me a better teacher. I’ve heard it a thousand times that you need to make time for yourself as a teacher or else you’ll get burnt out fast, but for some reason I always thought “okay, but that will never work for me, I don’t have that kind of time.” Well I prioritized and made time, and now crazy enough my schoolwork goes quicker so I have MORE time on my hands. I’m honestly shocked at this turnaround because before break I felt exhausted daily, my lessons were awful, and I didn’t know if I was gonna make it through the year.

I just wanted to share my success because I know this subreddit can be really negative. And maybe someone else will take inspiration from this and it’ll help them too!",478,compound,0.98,2020

And I'm sure it's been a lot more tempting and easier for students to copy off of one another, let alone lifting information straight from another website.

My problem is: 

Students know that all of this online jazz matters very little. In some places, it doesn't matter at all. Ethically, however, I feel like I have an obligation to still treat copying/plagiarism seriously. It just feels like a real struggle.

And I'm sure it's been a lot more tempting and easier for students to copy off of one another, let alone lifting information straight from another website.

My problem is: 

Students know that all of this online jazz matters very little. In some places, it doesn't matter at all. Ethically, however, I feel like I have an obligation to still treat copying/plagiarism seriously. It just feels like a real struggle. Normally I'd talk to students face-to-face and we would have a conversation. But now I can't do that (private video chats are discouraged). Tone is very difficult to convey online.

* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

1. These students aren't your kids that you gave birth to/adopted
2. You are NOT a counselor.
3. You CANNOT fix the system single-handedly.
4. You CANNOT force students to do what they don't want to do.

6. **Quit taking their behaviors personally. If they hate you, who cares? You're an adult. It's not your job to make yourself pleasing and likable to every student you teach.**

If my students don't want to pass or succeed, fine with me. It's not hurting my feelings and I am not losing sleep over kids that aren't going to be doing well in the future. I have no interest in holding their hands either. Meaning, I am not going to keep track of their passwords, know where their classes are (specific room), know every teacher that teacher whatever subject, etc. Yes, I CAN help out and I will but I'm not going to be doing the listed above for all students for an entire year.

I do try to motivate my students, I do make my classes positive, but I also answer their questions about reality and life outside of school. Most of my students have this grand delusion that their parents will be paying their bills and supporting them. Crazy.

Grades don't exist anymore. Here at least, and in a bunch of other states. So, obviously, I get a bunch of emails like ""Do I *have* to do this?"" ""Is this *required?*"" ""Is this graded?"" 

And I tell them straight up, **nope**. Whatever your grade was before we closed will be your grade, unless you were failing then you have to do some sort of make up to get to passing\*.

Long story short, some other teacher was ""OH DON'T TELL THEM THAT!"" Excuse me, it's not my job to lie to people (or even *obfuscate* the truth), fucko.

I am 100% empathetic to the plight of teachers. I have written much about education, and you should know I actually wanted to die when I first started teaching:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ewz0p4/on_a_friday_night_i_bet_you_just_want_to_relax

In fact, I tell my students all about gratitude. And I still do online. Here is why we should be thankful.

**Gratitude**

1) We are still getting paid: How many businesses are being shut down? It will only get worse. At least we have some security for the rest of the year.

2) We are not in the frontlines: My husband works in healthcare. Who knows what will happen? I pray every day for him.

3) We can breathe: Look, online learning can be stressful but most of us are benefiting. We are less stressed. Some are losing weight. Some of us are cleaning the things we never cleaned before. For teachers, this is not exactly a disaster.

4) We can learn new things: How many times have we criticized our students for not wanting to learn? We need to change our attitudes here.

5) We can show the truth: How many times do parents/society not believe us about students? Well, things may change a little here. I have seen more ""teacher appreciation"" memes in one month than I have in my lifetime.

If someone sees a ""lazy"" teacher during this time, that looks bad. Give it your all.

So what? 2 kids participate. Give those kids what they need.

6) Revolution: Parent/teacher relationships are generally weak. Let us work on changing this. Could we bring a revolution here?

**Conclusion**

Online learning is frustrating, but there is something called gratitude. We have no idea what can happen tomorrow.

I understand that different districts have varying levels of online availability. 

I understand many are frustrated.

 But I am entirely thankful right now.

Why? So many parents think it is ""us."" But many are realizing they are now apart of this. Even teachers and counselors! So many are saying they can barely control their kids right now...

I try my best to feel EMPATHY for my kids every day and dictate actions accordingly.

I listen to their problems and issues and opinions because I know they don’t usually get such privileges at home. I also know they struggle with reading and writing so I differentiate and teach to their level.

What I can’t stand is people looking at these kids and simply giving them things just because they feel sorry. At my school we can’t give a kid lower than a 60 on anything even if they don’t turn something in and I rarely if ever in all my 15 years as a Title I teacher have seen a kid retained. I heard the excuse that the kids have rough home lives so they should be given an equal chance to succeed. I even heard one case where a student didn’t retain a student because he was Latino and they didn’t want to appear “racist”. What it really teaches them is if you do nothing you’ll still be passed along because people feel bad for you. In the real world if you do nothing you don’t get 60% of your paycheck you get shown the door and fast. My school also implemented PBSIS. Detentions and suspensions even for serious things like hurting a child, stealing, having electronics out constantly are dealt with with conferences and reflections. I heard similar excuses of “oh these kids have a lot going on we need to find out what’s making them do this.” While I always have a talk with my students when they act out I feel like there still should be consequences to their actions. If that kid grows up and breaks a law no one will want to know why they did it. It’ll be real simple you broke the law you go to jail/pay a fine/do community service. 

I feel like we need to have higher expectations for these kids. And by letting them slack off we limit their true potential. Some people use the conditions they grow up in as a crutch and some rise above it. We’ve had several students in my school go to Ivy League schools. All of them didn’t expect anyone to feel bad for them. They knew they got dealt a bad hand, but because they knew that they busted their ass to get out of it. Like I said I feel we should recognize where our students come from, but also never accept it as an excuse for being lazy or not being the best they can possibly be.

What it really teaches them is if you do nothing you’ll still be passed along because people feel bad for you. In the real world if you do nothing you don’t get 60% of your paycheck you get shown the door and fast. My school also implemented PBSIS. Detentions and suspensions even for serious things like hurting a child, stealing, having electronics out constantly are dealt with with conferences and reflections. I heard similar excuses of “oh these kids have a lot going on we need to find out what’s making them do this.” While I always have a talk with my students when they act out I feel like there still should be consequences to their actions. If that kid grows up and breaks a law no one will want to know why they did it. It’ll be real simple you broke the law you go to jail/pay a fine/do community service. 

I feel like we need to have higher expectations for these kids. And by letting them slack off we limit their true potential. Some people use the conditions they grow up in as a crutch and some rise above it. We’ve had several students in my school go to Ivy League schools. All of them didn’t expect anyone to feel bad for them. They knew they got dealt a bad hand, but because they knew that they busted their ass to get out of it. Like I said I feel we should recognize where our students come from, but also never accept it as an excuse for being lazy or not being the best they can possibly be.

I keep waiting for the union to step in and say, ""NO video conferencing for those under 13"", but nothing has come forth yet. Here are some vague reasons I could use  help in articulating:

1. Feels like an invasion of privacy for them and I. My whole career I've been told to not contact my students via text or phone, much less video chatting with them. Now that's all out the window? I want my home to be a completely student-free sanctuary.
2. I don't want the slim chance of someone hacking into the session and showing inappropriate things (or students doing that). I would be devastated if that happened and feel guilty for a REALLY LONG TIME (even though it clearly wasn't my fault).

HELP?I'm having trouble articulating why I'm VERY uncomfortable with using Zoom or Hangouts to interact with my 5th grade students. My principal is pushing it but I don't quite know how to tell her I don't want to do it. I keep waiting for the union to step in and say, ""NO video conferencing for those under 13"", but nothing has come forth yet. Here are some vague reasons I could use  help in articulating:

1. Feels like an invasion of privacy for them and I. My whole career I've been told to not contact my students via text or phone, much less video chatting with them. Now that's all out the window? I want my home to be a completely student-free sanctuary.
2. I don't want the slim chance of someone hacking into the session and showing inappropriate things (or students doing that). I would be devastated if that happened and feel guilty for a REALLY LONG TIME (even though it clearly wasn't my fault).

However, they can be so disrespectful, especially the middle schoolers. I've seen them make a co-worker of mine cry. I hate disciplining students. It makes me feel awful. It is the part of the job that is driving me away the most.

Have any other teachers felt this way their first year and did it get better? I find myself really wanting to leave the career.",573,compound,-0.9412,2020

-Teaching a full class load of 185 students (which of course includes lesson planning, grading, teaching lessons, and answering no less than 500 questions a day such as “can I go to the bathroom?” “What time does this class end?”

-Hosting an intern and an undergrad student in my class who need observation hours for college 

-Managing 3 assistants 

-take the students on a field trip right in the middle of testing 

-create a new school club for Hispanic students per the AP request 

....AND it’s time to start WIDA testing, which means preparing the following for 226 ELL student school wide:

-put name labels on all test books
-sharpen a pencil for each of them
-create and organize test schedule 
-type up and prepare parent testing notification letters
-distribute letters
-create student testing passes
-distribute passes to students in the right order
-locate enough CD players for the test instructions (easier said than done apparently)
-email individual testing calendar to all teachers with each students name 
-get called to random meetings with county supervisor to discuss student learning gains and collaborate to create new ways to support students (aka more work for me)

This is by far the worst time of year. Currently dealing with:

-Teaching a full class load of 185 students (which of course includes lesson planning, grading, teaching lessons, and answering no less than 500 questions a day such as “can I go to the bathroom?” “What time does this class end?”

-Hosting an intern and an undergrad student in my class who need observation hours for college 

-Managing 3 assistants 

-take the students on a field trip right in the middle of testing 

-create a new school club for Hispanic students per the AP request 

....AND it’s time to start WIDA testing, which means preparing the following for 226 ELL student school wide:

-put name labels on all test books
-sharpen a pencil for each of them
-create and organize test schedule 
-type up and prepare parent testing notification letters
-distribute letters
-create student testing passes
-distribute passes to students in the right order
-locate enough CD players for the test instructions (easier said than done apparently)
-email individual testing calendar to all teachers with each students name 
-get called to random meetings with county supervisor to discuss student learning gains and collaborate to create new ways to support students (aka more work for me)

I’m just frustrated by the lack of support or acknowledgement that we are in a weird place in our profession and operating at a massive disadvantage.

I can’t tell you how many social media and twitter posts I’ve seen where parent states that he/she had to write a stern email to his/her child’s teacher to protect his/her child’s sanity and mental health during the lockdown. That they refuse to do their little online school thing and they’ll see the school next school year.

I’m curious to hear educator opinions on this.

Here are my thoughts or observations:
- many of these posts seem slightly antagonistic towards the teacher, as though we have put the student in this situation on purpose...when many of us don’t want to be in this situation either. We didn’t choose this, and we want the best for the kids. We are doing the best we can.
- is there a general policy on absenteeism for your school or district that would make this a bigger conversation than just an email to a teacher?
- if a parent decides his/her child is finished with school this year, are we concerned with next level readiness? I mean, this situation is unprecedented, but we also cannot set up students for failure if they aren’t ready for the next grade level or course?
- I am sure that many students are feeling stressed and having challenges managing a new schedule. This may seem crass or insensitive, but how much of this is the parent deciding that he/she can’t manage the child and taking this responsibility off the parental plate (I’m sure it’s hard—jobs, financial strain, this time is stressful for adults, in general), and projecting their stress and inability to cope on the kid? Again, not to be dismissive, but I’m slightly skeptical that it wouldn’t be in the best interest of a child to have some kind of routine or familiar attachment to “normal” times, even though there’s nothing normal about this. I’m aware that many school systems are struggling, and not all students have equal access to devices, the internet, or online platforms. I don’t get the sense that the parents tweeting about it are of that demographic, given the commonalities among the ones I’ve seen.

They generally think that teachers are overpaid because of all the time off, and that our job is easy. After I got my first teaching job, my sister in law decided to go back to school (she has an associates degree) to become a teacher too, because our schedule is so great, and she loves kids, so she wants to teach kindergarten since that’s, in her words, the easy stuff. (I teach high school English, but my own kids are in kindergarten and I know she’s so off base here!)

Except she can’t pass the Basic Skills test to enter the program. She’s failed it four times now. This is not surprising to me - she struggles with school, pressures me to practically write her essays for her, and she is a super permissive parent, so her own kids regularly have big behavioral problems. She and my mother in law are astounded that she can’t pass this test. They rant about how teaching is so easy, any idiot could do it, the test is so pointless, she’s definitely smarter than other people she knows who have passed it (my mother in law side eyes me while saying this), etc. (As an aside, I know the test has its issues, but in this case I think it’s doing its job - preventing a bad candidate from becoming a teacher.

They generally think that teachers are overpaid because of all the time off, and that our job is easy. After I got my first teaching job, my sister in law decided to go back to school (she has an associates degree) to become a teacher too, because our schedule is so great, and she loves kids, so she wants to teach kindergarten since that’s, in her words, the easy stuff. (I teach high school English, but my own kids are in kindergarten and I know she’s so off base here!)

Except she can’t pass the Basic Skills test to enter the program. She’s failed it four times now. This is not surprising to me - she struggles with school, pressures me to practically write her essays for her, and she is a super permissive parent, so her own kids regularly have big behavioral problems. She and my mother in law are astounded that she can’t pass this test. They rant about how teaching is so easy, any idiot could do it, the test is so pointless, she’s definitely smarter than other people she knows who have passed it (my mother in law side eyes me while saying this), etc. (As an aside, I know the test has its issues, but in this case I think it’s doing its job - preventing a bad candidate from becoming a teacher.

I'm dead to the world. I neglect friendships, my health, and my household cleaning. I have a much better work/life balance than I did last year, but I still recognize how unhealthy I am during the school year.

So, I'm wondering a few things:

* Are there any teachers out there who are in this situation? How do you deal?
* Are there any teachers who have found ways to manage the draining feeling after returning home?
* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

“funny, but aren’t you just a teachers aide?”

They work in a field totally unrelated to education and they are one of those very opinionated types that see the world in extremes.

I stared at the comment for awhile before I cried a bit. Somehow a few simple words from someone who doesn’t even matter was able to cut to my heart and bring some old insecurities to the surface.

I went to college for education, but chose to just get an associates, not my bachelors, because I didn’t want to put myself in massive amounts of debt. My family judged me for it but I knew for my mental health and financial well being, that was the best choice for me.

The teacher is having a rough time with a student? No problem! I’ll switch roles with her and lead the lesson while she helps that child.

A child is struggling with certain letters? I got this! Let’s work on this together and find the best way to learn.

I listen to their problems and issues and opinions because I know they don’t usually get such privileges at home.

What I can’t stand is people looking at these kids and simply giving them things just because they feel sorry. At my school we can’t give a kid lower than a 60 on anything even if they don’t turn something in and I rarely if ever in all my 15 years as a Title I teacher have seen a kid retained.

Some people use the conditions they grow up in as a crutch and some rise above it. We’ve had several students in my school go to Ivy League schools. All of them didn’t expect anyone to feel bad for them. They knew they got dealt a bad hand, but because they knew that they busted their ass to get out of it.

Since I don’t have a team to plan with, I always feel like I’m on an island trying to plan and fit all of the curriculum in. I just feel completely incompetent and overwhelmed. Recent parent emails questioning everything I’m doing have made me feel this way to an even greater extent.

I was initially certified biology but didn’t get the biology positions my district had for this year (both were offered to more experienced teachers) I’m on emergency license for math and am taking the math praxis to meet the requirements of the job I have now...but I really don’t want to come back next year. I didn’t anticipate having this little support as a first year teacher. I like math, but science is my love, and I want to actually collaborate with others. I’m hoping and praying a Science position opens up near me for next year. I can’t do this much longer.",661,compound,0.9537,2020

I am so frustrated, especially since I was just trying to do the right thing. The principal sent out an email to staff about 30 mins later saying again that we should post enrichment but to keep it “vague” with no due dates or points listed.

I've been teaching high school English for 4 years. Love teaching, love literature, love my students, can't stand the parents or the school culture or the unsupportive admin. It's a private school and it's very much a situation where the parents are just paying to buy a vowel and the admin's stance is that ""the customer is always right."" I'm tired of not being treated like a professional and being verbally abused by these parents. I've been planning my next move for a while. I've been accepted to an M.F.A. program in Creative Writing. Ultimately my goals are to 1) publish books 2) teach creative writing at the college level. The program will take me 5 years.

I really don't think I can continue my current position while earning the degree. My essay grading load is stressful enough after work hours as it is. My plan is to finish out this school year and look for basic office jobs at the University. If I get a job at the University, I will be on campus and my tuition will be covered. Problem is, I can't begin that job search until after Spring Break so things are a bit up in the air right now. Even if I can't get a job at the University, I can't attend graduate school while teaching AP Literature + 3 other preps.

I hear you, but this is the other thing: the head of my department wants to step down from his position and he's going to let them know on his letter of intent that he doesn't want to be English Department Chair anymore.

To try to make a long story short: I graduated in 2010 with my History/Education degrees but then couldn't find a job. Ended up teaching part-time at an after-school academy, then worked at a law firm in 2012. While working there, I looked for jobs periodically but didn't find a job that seemed ""right"" (I was spoiled by attending and student teaching at great schools I think). Anyway, I decided to really dive into teaching again about a year ago and looked for jobs. Found a permanent/preferred substitute position at the school I attended growing up, and I've been there ever since.

I'm looking for full-time jobs again and I'm expecting more to come up toward the end of the school year. However, part of me doesn't quite feel ""ready"" to teach full-time since I feel like I've forgotten a lot about teaching, Social Studies content, etc.

Being a substitute helps in a way but also isn't the same as full-time teaching. As a substitute, my job is to execute the lesson plan of the ""regular"" teacher but at this school, Google Classroom is the main way of doing things, so most of the time I'm essentially telling students to access Google Classroom and do the work that was posted there. As the permanent substitute who is there everyday, I kind of view this as ""Student Teaching 2.0"" in that I'm trying to make an impression/audition for a job there (the administration and staff really like me, so I'm happy about that!). Part of trying to make a good impression means I try to look up some material for the class before I'm giving the work out so that I can answer students' questions as necessary instead of being the sub that doesn't care and just gives the work.

So basically, subbing helps me to stretch my teaching muscles again in terms of classroom management and my delivery of content (on the days that I sub for a Social Studies teacher, I am sometimes asked to teach the material), but is there anything I can do in the classroom when I'm subbing or when I'm at home to help myself feel more ready to teach full-time? Specifically in terms of Social Studies, I'm trying to go over the content/curriculum but I feel like there is so much to look over. I find myself knowing most things but then there are certain things that I'm going over at school like FDR's Three Rs and I have to look it up again. I'm also feeling a little lost in terms of NYS Standards and Common Core, since CC wasn't around when I graduated. Where do I start?

They generally think that teachers are overpaid because of all the time off, and that our job is easy. After I got my first teaching job, my sister in law decided to go back to school (she has an associates degree) to become a teacher too, because our schedule is so great, and she loves kids, so she wants to teach kindergarten since that’s, in her words, the easy stuff. (I teach high school English, but my own kids are in kindergarten and I know she’s so off base here!)

Except she can’t pass the Basic Skills test to enter the program. She’s failed it four times now. This is not surprising to me - she struggles with school, pressures me to practically write her essays for her, and she is a super permissive parent, so her own kids regularly have big behavioral problems. She and my mother in law are astounded that she can’t pass this test. They rant about how teaching is so easy, any idiot could do it, the test is so pointless, she’s definitely smarter than other people she knows who have passed it (my mother in law side eyes me while saying this), etc. (As an aside, I know the test has its issues, but in this case I think it’s doing its job - preventing a bad candidate from becoming a teacher. She’s the kind of parent where her 9 year old son attacked a preschooler because he doesn’t like how they looked, and she just pulled him off and said, “You need to stop! Go watch YouTube or something!” before offering a halfhearted apology and walking away.)

So I suggested she give substitute teaching a try to see if it’s really as easy as she thought. Saw them last night, asked how it’s been going, and oh my gosh...the kids are basically eating her alive, and she’s gotten in trouble with multiple schools for not following basic policies (releasing the class several minutes early because she needed a break, letting kindergartners leave class unattended, etc.) And she just can’t believe how much stuff they’re supposed to do in a single day, how hard classroom management is, did I know they’re supposed to be able to READ by the end of kindergarten, it took a whole five minutes for someone to get to the room every time she called for help, etc.

I'm dead to the world. I neglect friendships, my health, and my household cleaning. I have a much better work/life balance than I did last year, but I still recognize how unhealthy I am during the school year.

So, I'm wondering a few things:

* Are there any teachers out there who are in this situation? How do you deal?
* Are there any teachers who have found ways to manage the draining feeling after returning home?
* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

But I’m at work and I hear this group of older kids with their grandpa. “Why are there still Christmas trees it’s not Christmas anymore. I don’t wanna see it anymore” but I hear the cutest littlest voice say “Christmas tree and Christmas lights!” And she walks past the counter with the cutest smile and her eyes were so big and bright. She looked be about 3 or 4. I smiled so big and just watched her eye gaze all over the place. 

This is how I know I want children in my life everyday.",717,compound,0.955,2020

I really don't think I can continue my current position while earning the degree. My essay grading load is stressful enough after work hours as it is. My plan is to finish out this school year and look for basic office jobs at the University. If I get a job at the University, I will be on campus and my tuition will be covered. Problem is, I can't begin that job search until after Spring Break so things are a bit up in the air right now. Even if I can't get a job at the University, I can't attend graduate school while teaching AP Literature + 3 other preps. So I'm about 99% sure I'm leaving at the end of the school year (only way I would consider staying is if my school agreed to pay my tuition in full AND hire an additional English teacher. Yeah right!)

We don't get contracts until April, but my school sends us a ""Letter of Intent"" to sign in January where we indicate whether we plan to return, leave the position, or if we are undecided. If I select ""undecided"", I will have to schedule a meeting with my principal to discuss it. Obviously you're going to say ""just indicate you plan to return and don't sign your contract in April!""

I hear you, but this is the other thing: the head of my department wants to step down from his position and he's going to let them know on his letter of intent that he doesn't want to be English Department Chair anymore. Guess who's next in line for the gig? That's right, me. The only other teachers in our department are brand new or ineffective. No way in hell do I want that job. So, they are going to come to me about this position and I'm going to have an awkward meeting anyway where I have to explain why I don't want to take it.

So I'm considering writing ""undecided"" on my letter of intent. Our school is in a rocky place and they have had trouble hiring English teachers for a while now.

To try to make a long story short: I graduated in 2010 with my History/Education degrees but then couldn't find a job. Ended up teaching part-time at an after-school academy, then worked at a law firm in 2012. While working there, I looked for jobs periodically but didn't find a job that seemed ""right"" (I was spoiled by attending and student teaching at great schools I think). Anyway, I decided to really dive into teaching again about a year ago and looked for jobs. Found a permanent/preferred substitute position at the school I attended growing up, and I've been there ever since.

I'm looking for full-time jobs again and I'm expecting more to come up toward the end of the school year. However, part of me doesn't quite feel ""ready"" to teach full-time since I feel like I've forgotten a lot about teaching, Social Studies content, etc.

Being a substitute helps in a way but also isn't the same as full-time teaching. As a substitute, my job is to execute the lesson plan of the ""regular"" teacher but at this school, Google Classroom is the main way of doing things, so most of the time I'm essentially telling students to access Google Classroom and do the work that was posted there. As the permanent substitute who is there everyday, I kind of view this as ""Student Teaching 2.0"" in that I'm trying to make an impression/audition for a job there (the administration and staff really like me, so I'm happy about that!). Part of trying to make a good impression means I try to look up some material for the class before I'm giving the work out so that I can answer students' questions as necessary instead of being the sub that doesn't care and just gives the work.

So basically, subbing helps me to stretch my teaching muscles again in terms of classroom management and my delivery of content (on the days that I sub for a Social Studies teacher, I am sometimes asked to teach the material), but is there anything I can do in the classroom when I'm subbing or when I'm at home to help myself feel more ready to teach full-time? Specifically in terms of Social Studies, I'm trying to go over the content/curriculum but I feel like there is so much to look over. I find myself knowing most things but then there are certain things that I'm going over at school like FDR's Three Rs and I have to look it up again. I'm also feeling a little lost in terms of NYS Standards and Common Core, since CC wasn't around when I graduated. Where do I start?

I'm in my second year and I have gained around 25 pounds since getting hired last year. When I get home, I. Am. DRAINED. I'm like a robot; I drop my stuff, change, and get on the couch with my dog and my brain goes to mush. I'm just exhausted to the point where the thought of exercising is daunting. I don't know if it's because I'm overwhelmed as a new teacher or what. I'm not making this post to come off as the lazy slop I probably sound like... I understand the basic idea of eating less and exercising more. I actually play softball all summer long and am pretty active during summer, but during the school year? Forget it. I'm dead to the world. I neglect friendships, my health, and my household cleaning. I have a much better work/life balance than I did last year, but I still recognize how unhealthy I am during the school year.

So, I'm wondering a few things:

* Are there any teachers out there who are in this situation? How do you deal?
* Are there any teachers who have found ways to manage the draining feeling after returning home?
* Do any of you have any ideas for manageable changes I can make to eat better/get healthier?
* Is this just a rite of passage type of thing for new teachers with too many preps and it will all settle in time?

Sorry if this post comes off a little melodramatic! I just reread it and yeesh.

ETA: For context--I work in a Title I district with amazing students who have a huge need for social-emotional support. I am a constant ""go-to"" teacher when students need a little extra love, a snack, or just an ear.

But damnit I still work hard. 

I shared an education meme on my Facebook page - basically a gif of someone doing random tasks/looking confused with the caption “when you’ve had 3 weeks off of work and forget how to do your job”.  It was funny, lots of people liked/shared it, but I got one comment that really just hurt my heart and my pride...

“funny, but aren’t you just a teachers aide?”

Now the person who commented is a vaguely known acquaintance (one of those, we met a handful of times in back college so we added each other on Facebook type of friend). They work in a field totally unrelated to education and they are one of those very opinionated types that see the world in extremes.

I stared at the comment for awhile before I cried a bit. Somehow a few simple words from someone who doesn’t even matter was able to cut to my heart and bring some old insecurities to the surface.

I went to college for education, but chose to just get an associates, not my bachelors, because I didn’t want to put myself in massive amounts of debt. My family judged me for it but I knew for my mental health and financial well being, that was the best choice for me.

Fast forward 5 years and I LOVE what I do. I wake up everyday excited to go work, excited to see my students, to work with the classroom teacher, and to be whatever the class needs me to be.


The teacher is having a rough time with a student? No problem! I’ll switch roles with her and lead the lesson while she helps that child.

A child is struggling with certain letters? I got this! Let’s work on this together and find the best way to learn.


Again I am *NOT* saying I work as hard as licensed teachers so I mean no disrespect. But how cruel is it to refer to someone’s livelihood, *anyones* livelihood for that matter, as “just ____”

I shared an education meme on my Facebook page - basically a gif of someone doing random tasks/looking confused with the caption “when you’ve had 3 weeks off of work and forget how to do your job”.  It was funny, lots of people liked/shared it, but I got one comment that really just hurt my heart and my pride...

“funny, but aren’t you just a teachers aide?”

Now the person who commented is a vaguely known acquaintance (one of those, we met a handful of times in back college so we added each other on Facebook type of friend). They work in a field totally unrelated to education and they are one of those very opinionated types that see the world in extremes.

I stared at the comment for awhile before I cried a bit. Somehow a few simple words from someone who doesn’t even matter was able to cut to my heart and bring some old insecurities to the surface.

I went to college for education, but chose to just get an associates, not my bachelors, because I didn’t want to put myself in massive amounts of debt. My family judged me for it but I knew for my mental health and financial well being, that was the best choice for me.

Fast forward 5 years and I LOVE what I do. I wake up everyday excited to go work, excited to see my students, to work with the classroom teacher, and to be whatever the class needs me to be.


The teacher is having a rough time with a student? No problem! I’ll switch roles with her and lead the lesson while she helps that child.

A child is struggling with certain letters? I got this! Let’s work on this together and find the best way to learn.


Again I am *NOT* saying I work as hard as licensed teachers so I mean no disrespect. But how cruel is it to refer to someone’s livelihood, *anyones* livelihood for that matter, as “just ____”


I apologize for the rant but I hope someone here sees this and remembers that YOU are important. Your students love YOU. Whether you’re an aide, a teacher, etc. YOU make a difference each day.",813,compound,0.9625,2020

I’m honestly shocked at this turnaround because before break I felt exhausted daily, my lessons were awful, and I didn’t know if I was gonna make it through the year.

I've been teaching high school English for 4 years. Love teaching, love literature, love my students, can't stand the parents or the school culture or the unsupportive admin. It's a private school and it's very much a situation where the parents are just paying to buy a vowel and the admin's stance is that ""the customer is always right."" I'm tired of not being treated like a professional and being verbally abused by these parents. I've been planning my next move for a while. I've been accepted to an M.F.A. program in Creative Writing. Ultimately my goals are to 1) publish books 2) teach creative writing at the college level. The program will take me 5 years.

I really don't think I can continue my current position while earning the degree. My essay grading load is stressful enough after work hours as it is. My plan is to finish out this school year and look for basic office jobs at the University. If I get a job at the University, I will be on campus and my tuition will be covered. Problem is, I can't begin that job search until after Spring Break so things are a bit up in the air right now. Even if I can't get a job at the University, I can't attend graduate school while teaching AP Literature + 3 other preps.

We don't get contracts until April, but my school sends us a ""Letter of Intent"" to sign in January where we indicate whether we plan to return, leave the position, or if we are undecided. If I select ""undecided"", I will have to schedule a meeting with my principal to discuss it. Obviously you're going to say ""just indicate you plan to return and don't sign your contract in April!""

I hear you, but this is the other thing: the head of my department wants to step down from his position and he's going to let them know on his letter of intent that he doesn't want to be English Department Chair anymore. Guess who's next in line for the gig? That's right, me. The only other teachers in our department are brand new or ineffective. No way in hell do I want that job. So, they are going to come to me about this position and I'm going to have an awkward meeting anyway where I have to explain why I don't want to take it.

So I'm considering writing ""undecided"" on my letter of intent. Our school is in a rocky place and they have had trouble hiring English teachers for a while now.

What should I say?Here's the scoop. I've been teaching high school English for 4 years. Love teaching, love literature, love my students, can't stand the parents or the school culture or the unsupportive admin. It's a private school and it's very much a situation where the parents are just paying to buy a vowel and the admin's stance is that ""the customer is always right."" I'm tired of not being treated like a professional and being verbally abused by these parents. I've been planning my next move for a while. I've been accepted to an M.F.A. program in Creative Writing. Ultimately my goals are to 1) publish books 2) teach creative writing at the college level. The program will take me 5 years.

I really don't think I can continue my current position while earning the degree. My essay grading load is stressful enough after work hours as it is. My plan is to finish out this school year and look for basic office jobs at the University. If I get a job at the University, I will be on campus and my tuition will be covered. Problem is, I can't begin that job search until after Spring Break so things are a bit up in the air right now. Even if I can't get a job at the University, I can't attend graduate school while teaching AP Literature + 3 other preps.

To try to make a long story short: I graduated in 2010 with my History/Education degrees but then couldn't find a job. Ended up teaching part-time at an after-school academy, then worked at a law firm in 2012. While working there, I looked for jobs periodically but didn't find a job that seemed ""right"" (I was spoiled by attending and student teaching at great schools I think). Anyway, I decided to really dive into teaching again about a year ago and looked for jobs. Found a permanent/preferred substitute position at the school I attended growing up, and I've been there ever since.

I'm looking for full-time jobs again and I'm expecting more to come up toward the end of the school year. However, part of me doesn't quite feel ""ready"" to teach full-time since I feel like I've forgotten a lot about teaching, Social Studies content, etc.

Being a substitute helps in a way but also isn't the same as full-time teaching. As a substitute, my job is to execute the lesson plan of the ""regular"" teacher but at this school, Google Classroom is the main way of doing things, so most of the time I'm essentially telling students to access Google Classroom and do the work that was posted there. As the permanent substitute who is there everyday, I kind of view this as ""Student Teaching 2.0"" in that I'm trying to make an impression/audition for a job there (the administration and staff really like me, so I'm happy about that!). Part of trying to make a good impression means I try to look up some material for the class before I'm giving the work out so that I can answer students' questions as necessary instead of being the sub that doesn't care and just gives the work.

So basically, subbing helps me to stretch my teaching muscles again in terms of classroom management and my delivery of content (on the days that I sub for a Social Studies teacher, I am sometimes asked to teach the material), but is there anything I can do in the classroom when I'm subbing or when I'm at home to help myself feel more ready to teach full-time? Specifically in terms of Social Studies, I'm trying to go over the content/curriculum but I feel like there is so much to look over. I find myself knowing most things but then there are certain things that I'm going over at school like FDR's Three Rs and I have to look it up again. I'm also feeling a little lost in terms of NYS Standards and Common Core, since CC wasn't around when I graduated. Where do I start?

I have to put together a hospital observation unit with like 17 different permission slips and drug testing student and dealing with unvaccinated students not being allowed. It's on track but no one knows what we do with kids who can't jump through hoops. I'm also supposed to become a CPR instructor somewhere in there.

Blah blah blah, my art classes are easy to plan but the kids are lazy. More structure could help them. Programming is also easy because the kids are slow learner's so the content last longer.

They want me to build a house for wood shop (we can't afford that) and take the kids to competitions and stuff. These kids refuse to build 90% of the individual or group projects I try. The gradebook is not an effective carrot or stick. Woodshop is not a required class so I don't know why they signed up to take it. Ordering supplies takes way too long to fill out the paperwork and over a month to show up. Equipment is broken and I don't have time to repair it.",891,compound,0.1064,2020

I would really like to teach ESL more than English, and was looking into adding the ELD credential. It is my understanding that adding a second subject to an existing credential isn't too difficult-- take a methods course and demonstrate subject competency. However, I was wondering if those steps need to be taken /after/ the first subject is completed, or if I can complete those steps prior/concurrent with my initial credential. 

TLDR;

1. If I pass the ELD CSET and take a methodology course prior/concurrent to receiving my initial credential, can I add the ELD subject after I complete the first English subject, or do I have to do the steps after completing the credential?

2. Would a 5 quarter unit class that is for the English learner clearance count as a methodology class for the ELD credential?

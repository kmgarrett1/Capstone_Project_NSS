I love fifth grade, and I love watching the kids grow up during this time. It is the middle of the year, and I finally snapped and sent out what might be my favorite email I've ever written. Don't get me wrong, I love my students and I love teaching them, but let's be real...5th graders can get pretty stinky.

After a field trip where they were walking a far distance, they all came into my classroom and took off their jackets at the same time...the air grew 100 pounds heavier and I felt like my nose was burning. I told them straight up that they needed to wear deodorant, and they all just laughed.

After school, I sent out this email:


&gt; As all of you know, your children are growing into the wonderful little human beings they are. That being said, with great changes comes great responsibility.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of our students are getting to the point in their lives where hygiene becomes a vital part of everyday routine. Everything from washing their hands after using the bathroom to putting on deodorant become important habits to form at this age. We all remember ""that kid"" in middle school who didn't discover deodorant until they were in their last week of eighth grade. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, as a fifth grade community, we encourage you to begin having the kids form these habits at home. [Partner teacher] and I encourage you to get your child in the habit of putting on deodorant and to continue encouraging clean habits inside and outside of school.
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, [Partner teacher] and I are requesting donations of hand sanitizer to put around the classrooms to maintain a minimal level of germs and to help us stay healthy during this winter season.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a wonderful rest of your evenings and let me know if you have any questions -


 
The responses I've received back from the parents are absolutely hilarious. All of them understood the sub-text in the email. They all took it so well, and one mother even told me she printed it out and put it in her son's scrapbook!

Anyway - just thought I'd share. I love teaching and little moments like this make it so worth it.

""Oh, yes. The impact of the result is far more effective if returned to the student as quickly as possible.

No real trick to it, really. I consider everything in life as an ""inbox."" Like email.

Every night I make it point to go to sleep with an empty inbox, having responded to and attended to every email received that day. This way it does not build up even a day.

From email, to grading, to phone calls, even to the refrigerator, everything is seen as an inbox. Take care of the tasks within before going to sleep. Wake up with a clean inbox each day.

Any email that sits in your inbox longer than necessary is wasted brain power. You are staring at the same idea or task again and again, leaving new ones not to be addressed. Your mind has only so much ""bandwidth"" per day. FIll it up with the same ideas or tasks each day and you never progress to anything new.

Same is true for grading. The day it is due, it is graded. Sitting on a task that can be done that day is a horrible practice. It will build up and you'll be kicking yourself for the ""marathon"" grading you have to do over your precious weekend. (There are other ""inboxes"" to attend to during the weekend.)

Make the grading an enjoyable part of your day. That's what most seem to overlook. You are still ""connected"" to your students when you do. I look forward to it because I go to my favorite coffee shop, listen to my beloved podcasts, and enter into my zone. It is quiet (after a day of teaching) and peaceful.

Before I know it, it's done. It's rewarding to complete the task, too. Feel accomplished. I can enter class proudly and show my students the confidence it takes to be a teacher.

It is the first thing they will notice...how you work. Model it. You returning assignments to them quickly and timely will teach them a valuable life lesson, ideally, they will model.

After all, is it fair to ask them to turn in something on time, if you cannot get it back to them on time?

They will respect you, your subject, and take what you have to say seriously.

Get it into your mind that tomorrow new ideas and tasks must be tackled. Thus, today's must be cleared out.

Simply look forward to the calm and ""zen"" of grading by making it your own time. Create that ""space"" in which you do it within as an inviting one.

After the actual teaching and interacting with the students, my second favorite part of the job is the quiet of preparing and grading.

Let's chat more. It's great you are on your way to being a teacher. Such a great calling.

This might be super obvious and well known to a lot of seasoned teachers, but this is one management trick that works like magic in my classroom: positive narration (didn't come up with it myself, but I do use it!).

Basically, when you ask students to do something, you narrate 3-4 kids who are following directions correctly. It is *especially* helpful when you positively narrate kids who do the right thing when they're sitting next to someone who is *not* following directions.

Example: ""I need eyes and ears on my in 3, 2, 1.""
""Thank you, James for your eyes"" (James did it correctly)
""Thank you, Jessica"" (Jessica did it, but her seat mate Mark did not. Mark 99% of the time realizes at that moment I can see him not following directions, and then self corrects).
""Thank you, Mark"" (Then Mark feels good because he was positively called out).

If you have a secret place, tell me and I will keep it secret. Though I admit I will probably forget to return it to its secret place and leave it at the whiteboard.

2. Space to put something down. A small spot will do. I like to bring age appropriate independent reading books for the grades I teach. It stops them from asking to go to the media center, and keeps them occupied when waiting for classmates.

2. Periodic spaces on your notes to write notes. Every period, topic shift, etc, you have, should have a space under it to write comments.

3. Specific rules about going to the media center, student seating charts, bathrooms, what do do when they don't have a pencil, special hand claps you use to get their attention, etc. Imagine I've never subbed before. This may not be so bad, since I usually have the students teach me, and the younger ones think its cool. Some will try to get one by me. Most of you name one or two students that I can trust. Thank you!

4. Plans on bright paper or a clipboard. Those notes are my life. You won't believe how often I can lose them in a room full of white paper over the course of the day.

5. When you write down a teacher's name that can help, make sure you mention which room. I forget the second she introduces herself and leaves. It must be the adrenaline.

6. Okay, this is obvious, but I need the front office number on the sheet, top of first page. Sometimes a school makes a phone list ~~is~~ by name and not by category. Also, it's one less piece of paper to search through.

7. The first place I go in your room is your desk to look for your plans. If for some very good reason, your notes are at the science worktable, the side table the guided reading group table, next to the guided reading group table on the floor, someone else's room, in a box, a binder, a drawer, a wall file, the front office, on the whiteboard, right behind the desk, on a shelf, at the window next to the door, please, please, just leave me a note on your desk and I will be happy to retrieve it and do everything it says on it

So I'm not a teacher yet, but I aim to be... today was hard. I was told by my supervisor that maybe I'm not made to be a teacher. It's been my dream ever since I was a kid and I always felt it was my goal in life. I'm a very calm and gentle person, but there seems to be 2 things missing with me: 

-I can't see everything in the classroom. I lack the special teacher vision that some have, where you know a student in the back is not working and the other next to him has not tied his laces... 

-I'm not well organized and I can't find the answers to things without people telling me. It's hard to explain, but when I think something is ''Logical'' and ''works'' it's actually not efficiant at all and simply doesn't work... There's always a better way of doing something and I just can never see it. 

So today, I feel like I'm trapped. I want to be a teacher, but the 40+ hours in school followed by 10+hours of work at home scares me. I'm 2 years into university and with the student loans I know I can't stop or switch BACC.... And even if I did, I have no idea what I want to do in life other than school... I just know I don't want to do a 40 hours a week work that will be repetitive and not bring me joy. 

I'm sorry if this feels like a Off My Chest post, but I figured maybe people here could relate or give advice.

So I'm not a teacher yet, but I aim to be... today was hard. I was told by my supervisor that maybe I'm not made to be a teacher. It's been my dream ever since I was a kid and I always felt it was my goal in life. I'm a very calm and gentle person, but there seems to be 2 things missing with me: 

-I can't see everything in the classroom. I lack the special teacher vision that some have, where you know a student in the back is not working and the other next to him has not tied his laces... 

-I'm not well organized and I can't find the answers to things without people telling me. It's hard to explain, but when I think something is ''Logical'' and ''works'' it's actually not efficiant at all and simply doesn't work... There's always a better way of doing something and I just can never see it. 

So today, I feel like I'm trapped. I want to be a teacher, but the 40+ hours in school followed by 10+hours of work at home scares me. I'm 2 years into university and with the student loans I know I can't stop or switch BACC.... And even if I did, I have no idea what I want to do in life other than school... I just know I don't want to do a 40 hours a week work that will be repetitive and not bring me joy. 

I'm sorry if this feels like a Off My Chest post, but I figured maybe people here could relate or give advice.

My jaw hit the floor. I was stunned for a good 3 seconds before I could run over to my computer and unplug it from the projector. Of course they were giggling but luckily it was my more mature section so they were understanding. I made a public apology and said I had NEVER intended to show that to them and just could not believe that had just happened to me. They were all good sports and told me it was ok and they understood.

All I have to say is 1. I am so glad I teach at a girls' school and 2. Thank GOD it wasn't a penis. Just a friendly reminder that the internet is full of horrible things, even if they seem fine at first. Learned the lesson of ""always preview the whole thing before showing it to the class"" the hard way...At least it's a good story I'll be telling for a long time.

So I'm not a teacher yet, but I aim to be... today was hard. I was told by my supervisor that maybe I'm not made to be a teacher. It's been my dream ever since I was a kid and I always felt it was my goal in life. I'm a very calm and gentle person, but there seems to be 2 things missing with me: 

-I can't see everything in the classroom. I lack the special teacher vision that some have, where you know a student in the back is not working and the other next to him has not tied his laces... 

-I'm not well organized and I can't find the answers to things without people telling me. It's hard to explain, but when I think something is ''Logical'' and ''works'' it's actually not efficiant at all and simply doesn't work... There's always a better way of doing something and I just can never see it. 

So today, I feel like I'm trapped. I want to be a teacher, but the 40+ hours in school followed by 10+hours of work at home scares me. I'm 2 years into university and with the student loans I know I can't stop or switch BACC.... And even if I did, I have no idea what I want to do in life other than school... I just know I don't want to do a 40 hours a week work that will be repetitive and not bring me joy. 

I'm sorry if this feels like a Off My Chest post, but I figured maybe people here could relate or give advice.

My jaw hit the floor. I was stunned for a good 3 seconds before I could run over to my computer and unplug it from the projector.

I made a public apology and said I had NEVER intended to show that to them and just could not believe that had just happened to me. They were all good sports and told me it was ok and they understood.

All I have to say is 1. I am so glad I teach at a girls' school and 2. Thank GOD it wasn't a penis. Just a friendly reminder that the internet is full of horrible things, even if they seem fine at first.

The principal and HR person gave me their schpiel about not coming back next year (non-re-election, they say; not sure if that's CA-specific), then stepped out so I could have a word with the union pres. She let me vent about my piece of shit principal for a minute, then pointed out that I have the option of finishing a letter of resignation by this Friday or just accepting the non-re-elect. In the former case, I don't ever have to say that I was fired from a job, but I'm ineligible for unemployment; in the latter case, vice versa.
 
I should add that I think I'm pretty close to done with teaching, at least in a conventional setting. My plan was to finish working through the end of next year to put some money away to start my own business and also to clear my teaching credential (which would allow me to keep it for life vs. it expiring in 2015; I think this is CA-specific). I find the bureaucracy and fundamental assumptions of the system as it stands to be heavily oppressive for both students and teachers. I once had a dream of transforming things from within, but, well, you can see where that got me. That said, I've been teaching for the last 6 years, and it is something that I'm good at and that I'd like to have some future prospects in as a fall back. So, I'd like some reddit advice, if I may be so bold:

* Should I take the non-re-elect or submit my letter of resignation? I'm pretty decided on this but I'm still interested in your input.

* How would the value of a recommendation from my principal compare with recommendations from my colleagues? I'm very well-respected by my colleagues, but my principal is highly insulated and poorly informed of even the most basic goings-on around campus, much less in my classroom. My obvious biases aside, I simply feel that my colleagues would have far better things to say about me as an actual teacher than my principal. Anyone have any experience with this?

* What have other people who've found themselves in this situation done about it?

Letter of resignation or non-re-elect?I was pulled into my principal's office after school today, where my principal, director of HR, and union president were waiting. The principal and HR person gave me their schpiel about not coming back next year (non-re-election, they say; not sure if that's CA-specific), then stepped out so I could have a word with the union pres. She let me vent about my piece of shit principal for a minute, then pointed out that I have the option of finishing a letter of resignation by this Friday or just accepting the non-re-elect. In the former case, I don't ever have to say that I was fired from a job, but I'm ineligible for unemployment; in the latter case, vice versa.
 
I should add that I think I'm pretty close to done with teaching, at least in a conventional setting. My plan was to finish working through the end of next year to put some money away to start my own business and also to clear my teaching credential (which would allow me to keep it for life vs. it expiring in 2015; I think this is CA-specific). I find the bureaucracy and fundamental assumptions of the system as it stands to be heavily oppressive for both students and teachers. I once had a dream of transforming things from within, but, well, you can see where that got me. That said, I've been teaching for the last 6 years, and it is something that I'm good at and that I'd like to have some future prospects in as a fall back. So, I'd like some reddit advice, if I may be so bold:

* Should I take the non-re-elect or submit my letter of resignation? I'm pretty decided on this but I'm still interested in your input.

* How would the value of a recommendation from my principal compare with recommendations from my colleagues? I'm very well-respected by my colleagues, but my principal is highly insulated and poorly informed of even the most basic goings-on around campus, much less in my classroom. My obvious biases aside, I simply feel that my colleagues would have far better things to say about me as an actual teacher than my principal. Anyone have any experience with this?

* What have other people who've found themselves in this situation done about it? I'm definitely fired, but I get to finish the year; are there opportunities that I can be taking advantage of that I wouldn't be able to otherwise?

""A mom is going to be out of town for awhile. Her daughter will be staying with friends. She sent an e-mail to the counselor to let us know.  At the end of the e-mail, was this...

Oh, I would appreciate if NO ONE but the people on her emergency contact list pick her up. I don't think anyone will try, but my husband and I both have...how do I say this politely....untrustworthy/batshit crazy parents/relatives and while she knows not to go anywhere with them, I'm sure she would if they insisted. They can be convincing. (Religious cult stuff, people who think they are *actually* the for real GOD, drunks and drug users, and one not yet convicted child molester.) I am sure they will not try to come get her, they haven't in the past, but I would like you to know how serious I am in no wanting her to go with anyone other than the people on her list. I have checked SIS to make sure these emergency contacts are up to date.

Thank you, Mom""

""Please excuse my daughter, Martha for being late. She was
having a hard time untangling her hair.
(She DID wake up early.)
 
Thank you.
Mrs. Martha's Mom
 
Oh, the drama of being a girl! PULEEESE!""

""A Mother came in the other day. Her daughter no longer attends our school, but wanted to get a yearbook to remember her time here.
The Mother brought in a list of student names, and asked a secretary her if she would get the signatures of all of the kids on the list for
her daughter!! I soooo wish I could tell you who it was, and you would TOTALLY understand.
By the way, the secretary declined....""

""A Mom calls~
   Mom- What time does my daughter have lunch today?
   Me- today it is at 11:15.
   Mom- so if I want to pick her up before lunch, what time should I come?
   Me - long pause.......ummmmm.....how about 11:10....
   Mom - Oh, ok, thanks.""

At the beginning of the school year, I looked through our data (grades &amp; several standardized test results).  There were several students (about 10-15 out of 70) that were inappropriately placed in an honors class.  I was told to just ""see how it goes with the readiness test"".  They flunked - horribly.  I was told that we ""need to give them a chance"", that they will remain in class.  

This small group of students have continued to struggle all year long.   I have had the curriculum director and our math coach come observe my classes to ask if there was anything I could do differently; their only suggestion was to move the seats of four students.  They couldn't come up with anything else and mentioned the lesson they saw as an example of a good way to teach linear systems in a subsequent professional development session because it went so well in all of my other classes.  This information was shared with my AP with a recommendation to move them out of my class.

Fast forward to now; only one student was moved.  The students have now been told they will have to repeat Algebra next year in high school.  Now my AP finally acknowledges that these students have been inappropriately placed and need to be moved, but the standard class is closed due to it being at full capacity so they have to stay in my class.

Our school has a policy that students that are not passing classes with a 'c' or better will have end-of-the-year activities taken away.   So I was called in the office to explain to the AP, the dean, and our school counselor what extra tutoring I will be providing to these students to get them passing my class so I'm not the reason they lose their end-of-the-year activities. 

Now, I just got an email telling me that they had the first parent conference and told the parents I will stay before school, during lunch, and after school to provide tutoring to get a student who has earned Ds &amp; Fs the last two years in math and is at the 35% percentile on standardized testing to pass an honors math class that is way beyond her ability level.

I really needed to vent, so thanks for listening.  

Any words of wisdom?  I have voiced my concern to my principal and curriculum coordinator and have started keeping detailed documentation of my conversations to prevent this issue next year.  I'm just frustrated with this year.  I feel bad for the kids because it's not all their fault.  They could have put in more effort, but I can't imagine being thrown in with that background.

I know it probably sounds selfish, but I'm already putting in a lot of extra time; I don't want to give up all of my time for a lost cause.  I'm annoyed at myself for such a negative attitude, but I think the person that created/didn't address this problem should have to help fix it.  But how do I tell the person that does my performance appraisal that he should fix it?

I'm a senior who's set to graduate this Saturday, and as the feeling has set in that I won't ever set foot on my high school campus again, I've been reflecting on the teachers I've had over the years.

To elementary teachers: thank you for setting the foundation for the rest of our lives. One of the best teachers I've ever had was my first and fourth grade teacher, and she truly changed my life. She cared about me as an individual, comforted me when I had bad days, and taught me empathy for others. I may not have learned the Quadratic Equation in her classroom, but I learned how to be a decent human being, and how to value critical thinking. Most of all, I learned how to be a good friend.

To middle school teachers: thank you for working with us through what is frequently the most difficult transitions of our lives. I moved from a very, very small town to a city middle school in seventh grade, and had it not been for a few inspirational middle school teachers, I would have probably completely lost hope in myself. That little bit of encouragement you give us each day when we work hard means the world, especially when we're in a period saturated in self-doubt and insecurity. I still clearly remember my gym teacher sitting with me after class and helping me through gymnastics I wasn't understanding, and I remember my English teacher proudly reading my essay to her classes (knowing not to call out my name, of course). Every bit of recognition pushes us to go forward.

To high school teachers: thank you for instilling in me the value of higher education and of setting clear, definite goals for myself. Without you, I wouldn't be able to pursue my dreams. The most inspirational teacher (and person) I have ever met was my high school history teacher, who has inspired me to possibly become a teacher myself. Thank you for teaching me to value myself and what I will be able to do in the future if I continue to work hard.

Thank you very much, you all. 
You create the future each and every day.

That little bit of encouragement you give us each day when we work hard means the world, especially when we're in a period saturated in self-doubt and insecurity. I still clearly remember my gym teacher sitting with me after class and helping me through gymnastics I wasn't understanding, and I remember my English teacher proudly reading my essay to her classes (knowing not to call out my name, of course). Every bit of recognition pushes us to go forward.

To high school teachers: thank you for instilling in me the value of higher education and of setting clear, definite goals for myself. Without you, I wouldn't be able to pursue my dreams. The most inspirational teacher (and person) I have ever met was my high school history teacher, who has inspired me to possibly become a teacher myself. Thank you for teaching me to value myself and what I will be able to do in the future if I continue to work hard.

Thank you very much, you all. 
You create the future each and every day.
I know that frequently kids don't say thank you, especially when they're shy, but please know that we will always remember you, and may regret not telling you in the moment. As adults, we will always appreciate what you have taught us.

You make a profound difference.",296,compound,0.997,2014

So I'm not a teacher yet, but I aim to be... today was hard. I was told by my supervisor that maybe I'm not made to be a teacher. It's been my dream ever since I was a kid and I always felt it was my goal in life. I'm a very calm and gentle person, but there seems to be 2 things missing with me: 

-I can't see everything in the classroom. I lack the special teacher vision that some have, where you know a student in the back is not working and the other next to him has not tied his laces... 

-I'm not well organized and I can't find the answers to things without people telling me. It's hard to explain, but when I think something is ''Logical'' and ''works'' it's actually not efficiant at all and simply doesn't work... There's always a better way of doing something and I just can never see it. 

So today, I feel like I'm trapped. I want to be a teacher, but the 40+ hours in school followed by 10+hours of work at home scares me. I'm 2 years into university and with the student loans I know I can't stop or switch BACC.... And even if I did, I have no idea what I want to do in life other than school... I just know I don't want to do a 40 hours a week work that will be repetitive and not bring me joy. 

I'm sorry if this feels like a Off My Chest post, but I figured maybe people here could relate or give advice.

* How would the value of a recommendation from my principal compare with recommendations from my colleagues?

My obvious biases aside, I simply feel that my colleagues would have far better things to say about me as an actual teacher than my principal. Anyone have any experience with this?

* What have other people who've found themselves in this situation done about it? I'm definitely fired, but I get to finish the year; are there opportunities that I can be taking advantage of that I wouldn't be able to otherwise? For example, I run a gardening program jointly with another teacher under the auspices of our science and health classes 4th period. It's very fledgling, and we struggle with approval from administration frequently, but the kids love it and it's an incredible learning machine. As a compromise, we run it 2 days a week right now, with the other 3 dedicated to more conventional lessons in our respective subject areas. Should I just say 'fuck it' and go a full 5-day week? Why or why not?

* How screwed would I be if I left the job before the end of the year? What are the consequences of this? On a similar note, what are my obligations to my students regarding this information? They will be sad and disappointed, and probably angry, but I don't want to be dishonest with them.

Well, the children's mother has recently found out about me and does not like the fact that I am in his life, not even the kids as of yet. I have met both children, but I do not wish to become involved in their life until I know that this relationship is going to last. Now that the mother has found out a lot about me, she has been posting slander to her facebook. Although she has very awfully accused me of being a home wrecker on her facebook for a few weeks now, I decided that ignoring the problem would help diffuse it instead of confronting her. However, several hours ago, she has accused me of using and regularly taking illegal substances. She has also called out the school I would like to work for and several people have already commented saying I need to be fired. 

I am a recent graduate from a major university and I have never taken an illegal substance in my life. Ever. I have already passed a drug test for my county. I was also a student at the school I would like to work for, played sports and was drug tested several times randomly and always came up clean. I am on very good terms with the administrators and many staff members. 

My question is how do I diffuse this situation? Should I go to the administrators first so I am not blind sided? Should I take legal action with proper documentation of the slander? Should I let it go and hope for the best? Thank you guys for the support. Reading back this sounds very trashy, but I promise you I am a good person. I have never dealt with something like this and need guidance from those who have also received slander from someone while in a professional position.

Tl;dr: I am certified to teach but someone is posting untrue slander about me that may make me lose my job. How do I handle this?

At the beginning of the school year, I looked through our data (grades &amp; several standardized test results).  There were several students (about 10-15 out of 70) that were inappropriately placed in an honors class.  I was told to just ""see how it goes with the readiness test"".  They flunked - horribly.  I was told that we ""need to give them a chance"", that they will remain in class.  

This small group of students have continued to struggle all year long.   I have had the curriculum director and our math coach come observe my classes to ask if there was anything I could do differently; their only suggestion was to move the seats of four students.  They couldn't come up with anything else and mentioned the lesson they saw as an example of a good way to teach linear systems in a subsequent professional development session because it went so well in all of my other classes.  This information was shared with my AP with a recommendation to move them out of my class.

Fast forward to now; only one student was moved.  The students have now been told they will have to repeat Algebra next year in high school.  Now my AP finally acknowledges that these students have been inappropriately placed and need to be moved, but the standard class is closed due to it being at full capacity so they have to stay in my class.

Our school has a policy that students that are not passing classes with a 'c' or better will have end-of-the-year activities taken away.   So I was called in the office to explain to the AP, the dean, and our school counselor what extra tutoring I will be providing to these students to get them passing my class so I'm not the reason they lose their end-of-the-year activities. 

Now, I just got an email telling me that they had the first parent conference and told the parents I will stay before school, during lunch, and after school to provide tutoring to get a student who has earned Ds &amp; Fs the last two years in math and is at the 35% percentile on standardized testing to pass an honors math class that is way beyond her ability level.

I really needed to vent, so thanks for listening.  

Any words of wisdom?  I have voiced my concern to my principal and curriculum coordinator and have started keeping detailed documentation of my conversations to prevent this issue next year.  I'm just frustrated with this year.  I feel bad for the kids because it's not all their fault.  They could have put in more effort, but I can't imagine being thrown in with that background.

I know it probably sounds selfish, but I'm already putting in a lot of extra time; I don't want to give up all of my time for a lost cause.  I'm annoyed at myself for such a negative attitude, but I think the person that created/didn't address this problem should have to help fix it.

Within a few days of reading the class began to complain about the book: length, understanding, POV, etc.  All, I thought, the complaints of students who are not used to a challenge.  

If you are familiar with the book, the fight scene in chapter 2 is graphic, but not overly so.  The complainers took this opportunity to add to their laundry list of reasons they did not want to read the book.  Then, in chapter 3, the narrator meets a character who, technically, commits incest with his daughter.  This, of course, blew the lid off things.  Those who did not want to read the book from the first finally had a solid reason to take home to their parents.  So those, half the class, walked out in unison after arranging for their parents to be waiting in the office.

I teach (first year as certified teacher) at a 1A school district: 330 students in all, from PK to 12.  My principal took the direction of the parents, which I actually supported.  Any involvement from a parent is a positive to me.  I agreed to stop the book, which had been bought for an AP class and had mistakenly been filed in the common bookroom.  

The next day a few of the same students attempted to override my decision on what we would do next by walking out again.  The resulting meeting in the principal's office was loud and vehement, primarily coming from me directed toward the students who had walked out.  The class split itself in two: one side apparently still willing to learn and produce work, the other on phones, talking, or just ignoring me.

This was just before Christmas break.

Now, 2 weeks after returning, I am still struggling for control of this class.  I have put everything in the past, moved on completely, and actually have more confidence than before.  Despite this, I feel like we are merely going through the motions.  There does not seem to be any drive from the class; active rebels or otherwise.

The question is: What would you do to bring things around?  We start the spring semester this coming Monday.  I want a fresh start.

If you are familiar with the book, the fight scene in chapter 2 is graphic, but not overly so.  The complainers took this opportunity to add to their laundry list of reasons they did not want to read the book.  Then, in chapter 3, the narrator meets a character who, technically, commits incest with his daughter.  This, of course, blew the lid off things.  Those who did not want to read the book from the first finally had a solid reason to take home to their parents.  So those, half the class, walked out in unison after arranging for their parents to be waiting in the office.

I teach (first year as certified teacher) at a 1A school district: 330 students in all, from PK to 12.  My principal took the direction of the parents, which I actually supported.  Any involvement from a parent is a positive to me.  I agreed to stop the book, which had been bought for an AP class and had mistakenly been filed in the common bookroom.  

The next day a few of the same students attempted to override my decision on what we would do next by walking out again.  The resulting meeting in the principal's office was loud and vehement, primarily coming from me directed toward the students who had walked out.  The class split itself in two: one side apparently still willing to learn and produce work, the other on phones, talking, or just ignoring me.

This was just before Christmas break.

Now, 2 weeks after returning, I am still struggling for control of this class.  I have put everything in the past, moved on completely, and actually have more confidence than before.  Despite this, I feel like we are merely going through the motions.  There does not seem to be any drive from the class; active rebels or otherwise.

The question is: What would you do to bring things around?  We start the spring semester this coming Monday.  I want a fresh start.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I was teaching Slaughterhouse Five (Vonnegut) to my sophomores. That was nixed, too. 2 chapters from the end!!!",364,compound,0.6648,2014

We're a big school, so it's somewhat unusual that my performance evaluator is the school principal. (The evaluator of most of the foreign language teachers is an administrator who is a former language teacher.)  My two previous observations with the principal went fine; he had some legitimate criticisms and some helpful feedback. Since he does not have a background in teaching foreign language and does not regularly observe any other language teachers, I feel he doesn't quite understand exactly what I'm doing or why. He also does not speak the target language.

THE OBSERVATION: He came in to observe (unannounced) during the last class of the day and it was clear that he was in a bad mood. He was short with one of my students who greeted him with, ""What's up?"" During my lesson, he was visibly bored and annoyed, got up to reprimand students passing by in the hallway, and also opened the door to the neighboring teacher's classroom and yelled at those students. 

Now I see his feedback from the observation, and it is barebones but harsh. Comments such as:

* ""Instruction was mostly English. When will all instruction be in the target language?"" (I polled other teachers while planning the lesson and they all said to teach this concept in English because it's complicated and has no English equivalent.)

* ""I think the activity has to do with the imperfect tense, but I am not sure how,"" (That's because I explained the activity to the kids *in the target language*, which he does not understand, nor did he ask.)

*  ""Lesson was bland,"" (I was delivering notes on new grammar concepts, I did my best to be succinct and I made a nice PowerPoint)

*""It's not clear that the teacher took attendance."" (WTF? I always take attendance, just because I didn't formally call role or he didn't see me with my clipboard doesn't mean I don't take attendance.) 

While it wasn't a knock-your-socks-off lesson, I stand by what I did and how I did it. I feel that his comments came from a place of not understanding my content area, and also being in a bad mood. I'm frustrated that his feedback contained no suggestions for ways to improve, and I'm frustrated that I can't get meaningful and constructive feedback from someone who knows my content area. But now that this observation is part of my employment record, how should I handle it? Should I respond via the evaluation website and leave it at that? Should I talk to him directly about it, and say what? (keep in mind he's a hard one to get face to face time with) Most importantly, how can I make sure this doesn't happen again?

She's involved with the school,  a bit innovative,  and cares about her students on a level that is totally unique to her. Now let's talk about that rumor.

What prompts a teacher's suspension? 
Do you think this is fair? 
Did she cross a line? 
She's such a great teacher,  why not just give her a slap on the wrist? Does that count as a slap on the wrist? 
 Does stuff like this happen often? 
Do you guys have to worry about stepping on a parent's toes like this? Does it affect how you teach negatively?
Are there any other repercussions for her actions? 
 Most importantly, when will she be back? 
We miss her, the school day is significantly more dull than usual.

Do you think this is fair? 
Did she cross a line? 
She's such a great teacher,  why not just give her a slap on the wrist? Does that count as a slap on the wrist? 
 Does stuff like this happen often? 
Do you guys have to worry about stepping on a parent's toes like this? Does it affect how you teach negatively?
Are there any other repercussions for her actions? 
 Most importantly, when will she be back? 
We miss her, the school day is significantly more dull than usual.

Also I know how you teachers are, so don't go through and grade me on my post, or anything.. I'm watching you.

But seriously,  I want your thoughts and any input you might have.  ",376,compound,0.9904,2014

We have a moderate discipline problem, which I and several of my colleagues trace back, in part, to an inconsistent and poorly respected administration. 

Today, we had a surprise lockdown drill that seriously shook my faith in my school. 

It started out as normally as such a thing can. My students followed procedure to the letter (l was super proud!) and we sat in the dark and waited for the all clear. Ten minutes passed, which was a little long, but my kids were total troopers.

And then the cops opened the door.

With a sarcastic ""good morning,"" they instructed my students to walk, single file, outside. There, surrounded by cops and dogs, they were instructed to remove their jackets and belts, turn out their pockets, and place anything in their pockets on the ground. The teacher accompanying the cops made a note of how many students had cell phones and then made a snide comment about how they should have a program where the school could take all their phones and send them to more deserving people.

The students were visibly confused, frightened, and angry. 

When they were done inspecting the students and had walked the drug dog through my room, we were filed back into my classroom and told to resume lockdown mode--lights out, blinds shut, kids huddled on the floor. We wanted there for another hour before the all clear came.

There was no shooter, no bomb threat, and no physical danger. The big find of the day was a blunt in some kid's car. Teachers received zero communication before and after the event and even a few of the senior teachers were pretty shaken up by the whole thing.

l'm a first year teacher, but l have been through random drug search lockdowns as a student and a student teacher and it was never quite like that.

This happened in the back of the classroom while I was reviewing grades with other students. As soon as I heard the commotion, I looked up in time to see both students throwing punches at each other, and I quickly broke up the fight and took them to the discipline officer where they were both given 10 days out of school suspension after the school administrators took statements from both students, myself, and witnesses. 

Student 1 (perfect attendance, good grades, participates in class) finally got tired of comments made about him by Student 2 (tardy, absent often, terrible grades, disrupts class) and told him to ""stop it"" while pushing the chair he was sitting in backwards to try and move the other student away from him. Student 2 slaps student 1 in the head knocking his glasses off. Student 1 lost it and punched Student 2 in the nose which resulted in both students getting a few more blows in before I reached them to break it up. Injuries were minor to both students, bloody nose and a black eye. I stand by the schools zero tolerance even though I would have probably done the same thing as student 1 did when I was in high school. 

With that said, Student 1 came to me the day before and asked to have his desk moved because of comments from Student 2. I told him that I was not going to move anyone just yet as we just re-arranged desks for the final 9 weeks and that I wanted them to try and get along and let him know that I would talk to the other student and if it happened again after today that I would take care of it. I did talk to Student 2 and he said he was just ""trying to be funny"" which I explained there was nothing funny about it and that it would not be tolerated, he agreed to keep his inappropriate comments out of the classroom, which of course he broke his promised the very next day. 

I feel bad for not moving Student 1 when he asked since he is such a great student. I also feel terrible for this kid who wants an education which was temporarily taken away from him by Student 2 who could care less. I am allowing both students to do work from home while suspended and so far only Student 1 has turned in his work, go figure. 

What are your thoughts on fights in the classroom and zero tolerance ?

EDIT: Thanks for everyone's comments. I know this is a tough subject. Our school used to have several fights per week before the zero tolerance (10 days out of school suspension) and now it is a few per year, but unfortunately as in this case I believe that 1 student who probably didn't deserve such an extreme punishment has this on his record. Chances are Student 2 will be sent to an alternate school since he is already on probation and has a history of illegal activities and verbal bullying. Student 1 will return to school and be given credit for work he as turned in and we can move forward. Hopefully Student 1 will think twice next time before he verbally abuses someone. 

EDIT 2: This has been good therapy for me. I have read every comment, considered every point of view, responded to a few comments, and I now have some better insight on this. 
IF I would have moved student 1 away from student 2 as requested then student 3 would have been in the same position as student 1 was previously in and may have just taken the abuse from student 2.
But, as a teacher I should know everything that is going on in my classroom, which I should point out is a large computer lab with a lot of moving around, no excuse, but it's not a traditional sit down academic classroom. I should know what is going on but sometimes I don't when I am engaged with other students on a hands on project. I will have to work on that. 
Thanks to everyone for your comments and viewpoints. This has helped me out tremendously, and I hope that I can learn from this to help students out in the future which is my main concern.

So I'm not a teacher yet, but I aim to be... today was hard. I was told by my supervisor that maybe I'm not made to be a teacher. It's been my dream ever since I was a kid and I always felt it was my goal in life. I'm a very calm and gentle person, but there seems to be 2 things missing with me: 

-I can't see everything in the classroom. I lack the special teacher vision that some have, where you know a student in the back is not working and the other next to him has not tied his laces... 

-I'm not well organized and I can't find the answers to things without people telling me. It's hard to explain, but when I think something is ''Logical'' and ''works'' it's actually not efficiant at all and simply doesn't work... There's always a better way of doing something and I just can never see it. 

So today, I feel like I'm trapped. I want to be a teacher, but the 40+ hours in school followed by 10+hours of work at home scares me. I'm 2 years into university and with the student loans I know I can't stop or switch BACC.... And even if I did, I have no idea what I want to do in life other than school... I just know I don't want to do a 40 hours a week work that will be repetitive and not bring me joy. 

I'm sorry if this feels like a Off My Chest post, but I figured maybe people here could relate or give advice.

That said, I've been teaching for the last 6 years, and it is something that I'm good at and that I'd like to have some future prospects in as a fall back. So, I'd like some reddit advice, if I may be so bold:

* Should I take the non-re-elect or submit my letter of resignation? I'm pretty decided on this but I'm still interested in your input.

* How would the value of a recommendation from my principal compare with recommendations from my colleagues? I'm very well-respected by my colleagues, but my principal is highly insulated and poorly informed of even the most basic goings-on around campus, much less in my classroom. My obvious biases aside, I simply feel that my colleagues would have far better things to say about me as an actual teacher than my principal. Anyone have any experience with this?

* What have other people who've found themselves in this situation done about it? I'm definitely fired, but I get to finish the year; are there opportunities that I can be taking advantage of that I wouldn't be able to otherwise? For example, I run a gardening program jointly with another teacher under the auspices of our science and health classes 4th period. It's very fledgling, and we struggle with approval from administration frequently, but the kids love it and it's an incredible learning machine. As a compromise, we run it 2 days a week right now, with the other 3 dedicated to more conventional lessons in our respective subject areas. Should I just say 'fuck it' and go a full 5-day week? Why or why not?

* How screwed would I be if I left the job before the end of the year? What are the consequences of this? On a similar note, what are my obligations to my students regarding this information? They will be sad and disappointed, and probably angry, but I don't want to be dishonest with them.

That said, I've been teaching for the last 6 years, and it is something that I'm good at and that I'd like to have some future prospects in as a fall back. So, I'd like some reddit advice, if I may be so bold:

* Should I take the non-re-elect or submit my letter of resignation? I'm pretty decided on this but I'm still interested in your input.

* How would the value of a recommendation from my principal compare with recommendations from my colleagues? I'm very well-respected by my colleagues, but my principal is highly insulated and poorly informed of even the most basic goings-on around campus, much less in my classroom. My obvious biases aside, I simply feel that my colleagues would have far better things to say about me as an actual teacher than my principal. Anyone have any experience with this?

* What have other people who've found themselves in this situation done about it? I'm definitely fired, but I get to finish the year; are there opportunities that I can be taking advantage of that I wouldn't be able to otherwise? For example, I run a gardening program jointly with another teacher under the auspices of our science and health classes 4th period. It's very fledgling, and we struggle with approval from administration frequently, but the kids love it and it's an incredible learning machine. As a compromise, we run it 2 days a week right now, with the other 3 dedicated to more conventional lessons in our respective subject areas. Should I just say 'fuck it' and go a full 5-day week? Why or why not?

* How screwed would I be if I left the job before the end of the year? What are the consequences of this? On a similar note, what are my obligations to my students regarding this information? They will be sad and disappointed, and probably angry, but I don't want to be dishonest with them.

Apologies for the length and any errors, but my brain is going a thousand miles an hour right now. I'm truly grateful for any perspective you all can offer me. Cheers.",444,compound,0.9934,2014

At the beginning of the school year, I looked through our data (grades &amp; several standardized test results).  There were several students (about 10-15 out of 70) that were inappropriately placed in an honors class.  I was told to just ""see how it goes with the readiness test"".  They flunked - horribly.  I was told that we ""need to give them a chance"", that they will remain in class.  

This small group of students have continued to struggle all year long.   I have had the curriculum director and our math coach come observe my classes to ask if there was anything I could do differently; their only suggestion was to move the seats of four students.  They couldn't come up with anything else and mentioned the lesson they saw as an example of a good way to teach linear systems in a subsequent professional development session because it went so well in all of my other classes.  This information was shared with my AP with a recommendation to move them out of my class.

Fast forward to now; only one student was moved.  The students have now been told they will have to repeat Algebra next year in high school.  Now my AP finally acknowledges that these students have been inappropriately placed and need to be moved, but the standard class is closed due to it being at full capacity so they have to stay in my class.

Our school has a policy that students that are not passing classes with a 'c' or better will have end-of-the-year activities taken away.   So I was called in the office to explain to the AP, the dean, and our school counselor what extra tutoring I will be providing to these students to get them passing my class so I'm not the reason they lose their end-of-the-year activities. 

Now, I just got an email telling me that they had the first parent conference and told the parents I will stay before school, during lunch, and after school to provide tutoring to get a student who has earned Ds &amp; Fs the last two years in math and is at the 35% percentile on standardized testing to pass an honors math class that is way beyond her ability level.

I really needed to vent, so thanks for listening.  

Any words of wisdom?  I have voiced my concern to my principal and curriculum coordinator and have started keeping detailed documentation of my conversations to prevent this issue next year.  I'm just frustrated with this year.  I feel bad for the kids because it's not all their fault.  They could have put in more effort, but I can't imagine being thrown in with that background.

I know it probably sounds selfish, but I'm already putting in a lot of extra time; I don't want to give up all of my time for a lost cause.  I'm annoyed at myself for such a negative attitude, but I think the person that created/didn't address this problem should have to help fix it.  But how do I tell the person that does my performance appraisal that he should fix it?

I'm just frustrated with this year.  I feel bad for the kids because it's not all their fault.  They could have put in more effort, but I can't imagine being thrown in with that background.

I know it probably sounds selfish, but I'm already putting in a lot of extra time; I don't want to give up all of my time for a lost cause.  I'm annoyed at myself for such a negative attitude, but I think the person that created/didn't address this problem should have to help fix it.  But how do I tell the person that does my performance appraisal that he should fix it?

Edit: I want to thank you all for your responses, ideas, and support. I am so thankful to have such support from so many dedicated educators.  Before posting I was really getting down on myself for thinking I was being selfish; thank you for setting me straight. I hope that others in this type of situation, which it seems is way more common than it should be, find it as helpful and comforting as I do.

If you are familiar with the book, the fight scene in chapter 2 is graphic, but not overly so.  The complainers took this opportunity to add to their laundry list of reasons they did not want to read the book.  Then, in chapter 3, the narrator meets a character who, technically, commits incest with his daughter.  This, of course, blew the lid off things.  Those who did not want to read the book from the first finally had a solid reason to take home to their parents.  So those, half the class, walked out in unison after arranging for their parents to be waiting in the office.

I teach (first year as certified teacher) at a 1A school district: 330 students in all, from PK to 12.  My principal took the direction of the parents, which I actually supported.  Any involvement from a parent is a positive to me.  I agreed to stop the book, which had been bought for an AP class and had mistakenly been filed in the common bookroom.  

The next day a few of the same students attempted to override my decision on what we would do next by walking out again.  The resulting meeting in the principal's office was loud and vehement, primarily coming from me directed toward the students who had walked out.  The class split itself in two: one side apparently still willing to learn and produce work, the other on phones, talking, or just ignoring me.

This was just before Christmas break.

We're a big school, so it's somewhat unusual that my performance evaluator is the school principal. (The evaluator of most of the foreign language teachers is an administrator who is a former language teacher.)  My two previous observations with the principal went fine; he had some legitimate criticisms and some helpful feedback. Since he does not have a background in teaching foreign language and does not regularly observe any other language teachers, I feel he doesn't quite understand exactly what I'm doing or why. He also does not speak the target language.

THE OBSERVATION: He came in to observe (unannounced) during the last class of the day and it was clear that he was in a bad mood. He was short with one of my students who greeted him with, ""What's up?"" During my lesson, he was visibly bored and annoyed, got up to reprimand students passing by in the hallway, and also opened the door to the neighboring teacher's classroom and yelled at those students. 

Now I see his feedback from the observation, and it is barebones but harsh. Comments such as:

* ""Instruction was mostly English. When will all instruction be in the target language?"" (I polled other teachers while planning the lesson and they all said to teach this concept in English because it's complicated and has no English equivalent.)

* ""I think the activity has to do with the imperfect tense, but I am not sure how,"" (That's because I explained the activity to the kids *in the target language*, which he does not understand, nor did he ask.)

*  ""Lesson was bland,"" (I was delivering notes on new grammar concepts, I did my best to be succinct and I made a nice PowerPoint)

*""It's not clear that the teacher took attendance."" (WTF? I always take attendance, just because I didn't formally call role or he didn't see me with my clipboard doesn't mean I don't take attendance.) 

While it wasn't a knock-your-socks-off lesson, I stand by what I did and how I did it. I feel that his comments came from a place of not understanding my content area, and also being in a bad mood. I'm frustrated that his feedback contained no suggestions for ways to improve, and I'm frustrated that I can't get meaningful and constructive feedback from someone who knows my content area. But now that this observation is part of my employment record, how should I handle it? Should I respond via the evaluation website and leave it at that? Should I talk to him directly about it, and say what? (keep in mind he's a hard one to get face to face time with) Most importantly, how can I make sure this doesn't happen again?

I'm teaching a group of kindergarteners today. We're in the middle of singing a song and a student, John, runs up to me. ""My nose hurts, Mr. CaseArcana"". I give it a once over, nothing out of the ordinary... whatever. Nothing much I can do about nose pains. I asked him if anything happened to his nose today and he shook his head ""no"". ""Go sit down.

She's involved with the school,  a bit innovative,  and cares about her students on a level that is totally unique to her. Now let's talk about that rumor. 
We have been working on research papers for her class, nobody enjoys stuff like this, except maybe you guys. I mean no offense but this stuff sucks.

She's never done this before.  I don't think it's a big deal.  We're high school seniors, I mean come on.

So I have about a thousand questions for you guys,  and I wanted to hear from you guys, the teachers. 

What prompts a teacher's suspension? 
Do you think this is fair? 
Did she cross a line? 
She's such a great teacher,  why not just give her a slap on the wrist? Does that count as a slap on the wrist? 
 Does stuff like this happen often? 
Do you guys have to worry about stepping on a parent's toes like this? Does it affect how you teach negatively?
Are there any other repercussions for her actions? 
 Most importantly, when will she be back? 
We miss her, the school day is significantly more dull than usual.

This happened in the back of the classroom while I was reviewing grades with other students. As soon as I heard the commotion, I looked up in time to see both students throwing punches at each other, and I quickly broke up the fight and took them to the discipline officer where they were both given 10 days out of school suspension after the school administrators took statements from both students, myself, and witnesses. 

Student 1 (perfect attendance, good grades, participates in class) finally got tired of comments made about him by Student 2 (tardy, absent often, terrible grades, disrupts class) and told him to ""stop it"" while pushing the chair he was sitting in backwards to try and move the other student away from him. Student 2 slaps student 1 in the head knocking his glasses off. Student 1 lost it and punched Student 2 in the nose which resulted in both students getting a few more blows in before I reached them to break it up. Injuries were minor to both students, bloody nose and a black eye. I stand by the schools zero tolerance even though I would have probably done the same thing as student 1 did when I was in high school. 

With that said, Student 1 came to me the day before and asked to have his desk moved because of comments from Student 2. I told him that I was not going to move anyone just yet as we just re-arranged desks for the final 9 weeks and that I wanted them to try and get along and let him know that I would talk to the other student and if it happened again after today that I would take care of it. I did talk to Student 2 and he said he was just ""trying to be funny"" which I explained there was nothing funny about it and that it would not be tolerated, he agreed to keep his inappropriate comments out of the classroom, which of course he broke his promised the very next day. 

I feel bad for not moving Student 1 when he asked since he is such a great student. I also feel terrible for this kid who wants an education which was temporarily taken away from him by Student 2 who could care less. I am allowing both students to do work from home while suspended and so far only Student 1 has turned in his work, go figure. 

What are your thoughts on fights in the classroom and zero tolerance ?

EDIT: Thanks for everyone's comments. I know this is a tough subject. Our school used to have several fights per week before the zero tolerance (10 days out of school suspension) and now it is a few per year, but unfortunately as in this case I believe that 1 student who probably didn't deserve such an extreme punishment has this on his record. Chances are Student 2 will be sent to an alternate school since he is already on probation and has a history of illegal activities and verbal bullying. Student 1 will return to school and be given credit for work he as turned in and we can move forward. Hopefully Student 1 will think twice next time before he verbally abuses someone. 

EDIT 2: This has been good therapy for me. I have read every comment, considered every point of view, responded to a few comments, and I now have some better insight on this. 
IF I would have moved student 1 away from student 2 as requested then student 3 would have been in the same position as student 1 was previously in and may have just taken the abuse from student 2.
But, as a teacher I should know everything that is going on in my classroom, which I should point out is a large computer lab with a lot of moving around, no excuse, but it's not a traditional sit down academic classroom. I should know what is going on but sometimes I don't when I am engaged with other students on a hands on project. I will have to work on that.

Here is my problem with this:  the student is in 8th grade and cant spell: floor.  LITERALLY.  When I have to grade essays or short answers the handwriting is terrible, but I am able to make it out - what I cannot make out is spelling.  Even with a given prompt when I know what they are writing about, I cannot understand the essay because the spelling is SO bad.  I will post an example below.  I have another student who is on a first grade reading level.  

All of this frustrates me because for the student on the first grade level: I cant imagine how scary it is to come into the room and pretty much know you wont understand what we are doing.  No, not an insult but level wise, it is true... thats a HUGE gap.  For the several students I have that I cant take off for spelling, grammar or handwriting... why are you in 8th grade English?  Once again, not an insult... I say this as - why are you here? you need extra help - why are services not available to help you? Its not the students fault, but I do not feel being in regular classes is doing them any justice by not even trying to fix spelling, grammar or handwriting. make sense?  

Like I said - there is no anger towards the student, the anger and frustration comes from not being able to give these students a fair grade and most of all - they need extra help to correct these issues that they are not getting.  Its killing me and makes me so mad... as an educator, isnt it our job to help TEACH these kids? Not just sweep problems under the rug?  I feel that I can only do so much...

When I have to grade essays or short answers the handwriting is terrible, but I am able to make it out - what I cannot make out is spelling.  Even with a given prompt when I know what they are writing about, I cannot understand the essay because the spelling is SO bad.  I will post an example below.  I have another student who is on a first grade reading level.  

All of this frustrates me because for the student on the first grade level: I cant imagine how scary it is to come into the room and pretty much know you wont understand what we are doing.  No, not an insult but level wise, it is true... thats a HUGE gap.  For the several students I have that I cant take off for spelling, grammar or handwriting... why are you in 8th grade English?  Once again, not an insult... I say this as - why are you here? you need extra help - why are services not available to help you? Its not the students fault, but I do not feel being in regular classes is doing them any justice by not even trying to fix spelling, grammar or handwriting. make sense?  

Like I said - there is no anger towards the student, the anger and frustration comes from not being able to give these students a fair grade and most of all - they need extra help to correct these issues that they are not getting.  Its killing me and makes me so mad... as an educator, isnt it our job to help TEACH these kids? Not just sweep problems under the rug?  I feel that I can only do so much... I keep trying and stay after school every moment I can to help these kids, but they need more. 

Rant over - so sorry.  I am grading today and came across one of the papers. Ex below

If you are familiar with the book, the fight scene in chapter 2 is graphic, but not overly so.  The complainers took this opportunity to add to their laundry list of reasons they did not want to read the book.  Then, in chapter 3, the narrator meets a character who, technically, commits incest with his daughter.  This, of course, blew the lid off things.

I teach (first year as certified teacher) at a 1A school district: 330 students in all, from PK to 12.  My principal took the direction of the parents, which I actually supported.  Any involvement from a parent is a positive to me.  I agreed to stop the book, which had been bought for an AP class and had mistakenly been filed in the common bookroom.  

The next day a few of the same students attempted to override my decision on what we would do next by walking out again.  The resulting meeting in the principal's office was loud and vehement, primarily coming from me directed toward the students who had walked out.  The class split itself in two: one side apparently still willing to learn and produce work, the other on phones, talking, or just ignoring me.

This was just before Christmas break.

So this past August I made an app, called Omni Study, that can track classes, assignments, and grades. While it's intended audience is primarily students, I have found that teachers can also highly benefit from the app, since you can put in all of your classes, class times, days, events/assignments.


Well, this past Thursday a HUGE update went out for Omni Study that added a lot of awesome new features and a brand new design. Since the Spring semester is about to kick off, I wanted to post this here as I think something like this can be a huge asset to a teacher.


Omni Study is $0.99 and supports the iPhone and iPad. I'm including some redeem codes you guys can use to try the app out for free though. Comment the code you used and I'll cross it off!

**Me**: ""That's a good question! Here.""

**S**: ""Ooh, candy!"" *enjoys candy triumphantly for a few seconds* ""So, are they?""

**Me**: ""No.""

**S**: ""Sir, you dashed my hopes and dreams! Now this candy doesn't taste so good anymore!""

In case anyone wonders, I define a good question as a question that:

 - Connects two different concepts in math
 - Connects math to some other discipline
 - Makes me tell a story about a mathematician
 - Is an unsolved or famous question in mathematics",523,compound,0.9723,2014

After my last year of college I will have my bachelors and masters in childhood special education (birth-6th). Right now, I am mostly thinking about teaching at an international school just about anywhere after I graduate.




So some questions I have...


Where did/do you teach &amp; what was the process like finding a job? How did you contact the school?


How do you know if the school you're going to teach at was reputable? I've read other threads where people said to be careful of the school.


Did they pay for your flight over to the country? Where did you go after your flight landed? Did they have an apartment set up for you or help you get one?


About how much were start-up costs? If they do pay for the flight, did they pay for the start of your apartment?


I guess in general, how much support did the school give you? I would be going alone (which I am excited to do) but don't want to go to a foreign country and have zero support when I get there.


If you're American, how many other Americans did you meet while teaching abroad? Was it easy to meet other people and make friends?


Overall, how was your experience?


I know it's a lot of questions and everyone's answers will vary depending on their experience but I am serious about teaching abroad and your answers will really help me! I have done a ton if research into it and these are the questions that I still have and haven't really been able to find.

I teach music. Specifically, I was asked a favor from a teacher that I help with 'judging chair auditions' at a school where I work. I know all the student's in this teacher's classroom. They know me well - I'm a familiar face and they're really a great bunch! 

So, a student we'll call ""Autumn"" plays flute. She comes in to audition. She is clearly nervous and tells me she is. ""Autumn,"" I say, ""look, it's me. I want you to do well."" She smiles and says, ""Mr. [Teacher], if it was anyone else, I wouldn't even bother auditioning. I'm so nervous."" 

Deep down inside, if you're reading this Autumn, that meant a lot to me. You and your class are very special to me, and if you're reading, you should know that I've been focusing my efforts for a considerable length of time on being that teacher - one who you aren't afraid to play for.

I care a lot about education and how to help people discover what interests them.  Check out my blog for more about me (vikparuchuri.com).

I have some experience in the edtech field, having worked on automated essay scoring and at edX (MOOC provider).  I have also worked on a couple of my own edtech tools, Movide(movide.com), and Sojurn(sojurn.io).

One of the big problems with edtech, I think, is that there are so many products popping up, and very few of the ideas for them seem to originate with teachers and students.  I myself made the mistake of making a big application with grand ambitions without consulting teachers beforehand.  It seems like the best tools are made by former or current teachers who have a ""direct line"" into what works, but I recognize that not all teachers have the time to make their own tools.

Which brings me to my point.  What tools do you want?  What would help you teach your class more effectively?  Help you connect with your students?  I can help build it.  

I have made web applications, browser extensions, and android apps, and could probably learn other stuff as needed.  I also have a lot of experience in machine learning (creating algorithms that predict things; think adaptive/personalized learning).  I will probably be able to build 2-3 ideas, and will try to select for maximum impact (# of users) and relative ease of development (I probably can't spend months working on one idea).

What do I get out of this?  As hokey as it sounds, I like building applications that help people.  It is hugely motivating to build tools that get used.  The best way to make things that get used is to make what people want.

I'm currently a Theatre Education major (in a South Carolina University) and student teaching in a North Carolina Middle School. My degree is in K-12 certification, so last semester I was in a high school once a week. Now I'm in a middle school everyday.

Just as I was getting used to my high school students, we went on holiday break. Over break, I spent my time learning more about game design and what it would take to run a business. I'd love to open up a toy/game/hobby shop one day.  

Another thing to note is that I'm not feeling as hot about theatre as I was going into college 3+ years ago. I love the ways we can collaborate as many different individuals through the art form, and I've even picked up some skills in lighting design and stage management, but in middle school, students really want to know about acting and performance. 

I started at the school last week and like the students and my CT well enough. My CT gave me an outline of her curriculum and I start with the 6th graders next Thursday. I'm sure I can do the job, but I'm just afraid my heart isn't in it. My supervisor, and my mentor teacher from last semester speak of me rather highly, and my current CT complemented me on the quality of feedback I gave the students last week. All of that just makes me feel worse about not being on-fire for teaching. 

One day, I overheard the band instructor telling a newer teacher, ""Sometimes it's a career, and sometimes it's a job."" I don't want to do it if I'm not on-fire about it, just to earn a paycheck and making a living. 

Today on the way to school, I beat up my car pretty bad. Then I started to feel foolish about wanting to open up a hobby shop just because I really like games and the like. Who am I to do that? Why don't I just stick to what I have the training to do? Will I end up like one of those ""it's just a job"" teachers? 

I love working with kids, which is part of why I'd want to open up a toy/game shop. To give kids a safe and fun place to hang out. Working with kids is also the original reason why I thought I'd be a good teacher. I'd get to be a good influence and teach them how to be better people. 

This year, I've seen something that unsettles me. I've noticed that students get stuck in our class because it's *just Drama*. There are too many students to help effectively. I saw the rosters for the 8th graders next semester and there are 35 students. The most I had in my high school placement was 22, and it was difficult getting things done then. Some high school students were only in it because they needed an arts credit and didn't want to sing/play an instrument/draw, then got fussy when they had to write and perform monologues. 

This is a lot and it seems really disconnected, but it made more sense in my head. If you made it through this, thank you for reading. 

TL;DR = Student teacher doesn't feel like his heart is in teaching and doesn't want to become one of those ""it's just a job"" teachers, still wants to work with kids by opening a toy/game/hobby shop, and is butthurt because 10% of his students want to be there (although, middle school is better in this respect).

I just want to lay it all on the table and get some information - 

- Am I out of my mind? Should I just go get a job as a programmer?
- How much coursework do I need before I can get into a credential program, and more importantly get in a classroom (from what I can see with my background, 3 semesters)? 
- Will getting a job as a math teacher be hard? Impossible? I read everything from ""getting a teaching job in California is impossible"" to ""everyone needs math teachers"".
- Give me your thoughts in general!

This is a long post but I'm hoping someone will slog through at least part of it. A lot of this is also to put the information in one place for myself.

I love the teaching part of my job (although I know teaching college students is not the same as teaching high school students), but I absolutely loathe research. I don't have any experience teaching high school students. When I was in college, I did individual tutoring of high school students from pre-algebra through calculus, although that hardly counts.

Why?

One of the things that makes me want to be a math teacher (and seems a little bit backwards) is not that I had good math teachers, but that I had *horrendous* math teachers, and I struggled to understand anything at all. I was saved by having a really good memory even though I understood almost nothing, but in college math classes that became a big problem. I felt for a long time that I wanted to be a math teacher because I do understand now, and I think I have a knack for explaining concepts in simple ways. Basically, I was always pushed in a different direction (getting a PhD at a top research university and becoming a professor at another top research university, blech).

My background: 

Education/Experience/Relevant things

Requirements I would need to do (as far as courses, the less interesting stuff) (from the handbook at http://www.csuchico.edu/soe/documents/ssp-hb-sec1-overview.pdf, page 9)

- Pass CSET math (not a problem, I could also pass business if it helps)
- Five prerequisite courses
- Seven credential courses
- at least three additional courses (I can't imagine not being able to waive of the foreign language requirement).

I'm looking at 4-5 semesters, but I might be misinterpreting the requirements.

I just want to lay it all on the table and get some information - 

- Am I out of my mind? Should I just go get a job as a programmer?
- How much coursework do I need before I can get into a credential program, and more importantly get in a classroom (from what I can see with my background, 3 semesters)? 
- Will getting a job as a math teacher be hard? Impossible? I read everything from ""getting a teaching job in California is impossible"" to ""everyone needs math teachers"".
- Give me your thoughts in general!

This is a long post but I'm hoping someone will slog through at least part of it. A lot of this is also to put the information in one place for myself.

I love the teaching part of my job (although I know teaching college students is not the same as teaching high school students), but I absolutely loathe research. I don't have any experience teaching high school students. When I was in college, I did individual tutoring of high school students from pre-algebra through calculus, although that hardly counts.

Why?

One of the things that makes me want to be a math teacher (and seems a little bit backwards) is not that I had good math teachers, but that I had *horrendous* math teachers, and I struggled to understand anything at all. I was saved by having a really good memory even though I understood almost nothing, but in college math classes that became a big problem. I felt for a long time that I wanted to be a math teacher because I do understand now, and I think I have a knack for explaining concepts in simple ways. Basically, I was always pushed in a different direction (getting a PhD at a top research university and becoming a professor at another top research university, blech).

My background:

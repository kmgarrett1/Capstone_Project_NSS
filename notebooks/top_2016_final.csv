I was entering my first year teaching at the high school level. The first day was last week and I had told all of my department members I was going to do it. Some of them even helped set it up.

The day went hilariously.

I wrote up on the board ""INSTRUCTIONS: Introduce yourself to as many people as you can and tell your *best* story!"" I had different coworkers come into my class period at the beginning of each prep and tell the students Mr. Augustane was running late making copies. My students were to begin the activity without me until I arrived.

I wore a hoodie over my dress shirt and tie and brought one of my old backpacks. During the periods I sat down in the seats and introduced myself as the new student named 'Jeremy Lin' and told some of my best stories. Dates and age were changed of course, haha. About 5-10 minutes after introducing myself and hearing several students' stories, I would step to the front of the class and stand on a table, then reveal myself... to the shock of all of my students. It was pretty funny how some students who were quite ~~caddy~~ catty looked when they realized who I was.

In one period in particular, however, I was seated next to a gentleman who proceeded to tell me ""Oh man, this period is going to go APESHIT."" The conversation continued like this:

Him: I had [name], [name], and [name] in my ___ class last year and we ~~wrecked~~ wreaked havoc. We drove that teacher nuts.

Me: Oh. [name], [name], and [name]?

Him: Yeah. They're cool guys. I'm pretty sure we're going to eat this teacher alive.

Me: Why?

Him: He's a first year teacher. They never know what the hell they're doing. All they ever do is stick to the textbook and generally suck.

Me: Do you know anything else about this Mr. Augustane?

Him: No, not really, but he's probably going to be really slow and boring. First year teachers always are. He won't have control of this class. I don't think he'll be any good.


At that moment, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said something along the lines of ""Don't worry buddy, I'm sure I'll do fine."" before stepping up to the class and revealing myself. The class really did go apeshit, but for different reasons. (:

The look on that kid's face was priceless. I was sure to thank him for pointing out all the trouble makers for me afterwards.

By 5th and 6th period, all the students were scanning around trying to figure out where I could've been hiding. They were accusing different Asian students of being the teacher.

Overall it was a great start before laying down the rules and syllabus the following day. I was nervous it was going to be a terrible idea, but now my students won't stop joking about it.

**TL;DR: Pretended to be a student. Found out my trouble makers and sent my students for a loop.**


Edit: Sorry about the title gore. Reddit was automatically capitalizing each of the first letters in my title...then it didn't for some of them?

Edit 2: Best of'd. Terrific. I just wanted to take this moment to remind everyone (especially those who aren't educators) that after this wonderful first day of school, even though I was the talk of the school and my students kept saying how awesome their English teacher was, I still came home and broke down crying for hours. Teaching is a stressful job. I couldn't have done it without the support of my family and coworkers, but not every teacher has that. It doesn't just end with the students in the classroom. We get evaluated, we memorize dozens of personalized learning plans for students with accommodations, and (first year teachers especially) we stay up well past our bedtimes perfecting our lessons. Whether you're in school or not, love your teachers past and present, because we love you.

Edit 3: If you're my student and ran across this… just… don't embarrass me in class. Okay? Okay.

Final Edit: Cat's out of the bag. Kids all know about it. Couple of my coworkers saw it on Reddit. Facebook exploded on me while I was teaching my last period. Guess there's no anonymity left. Enjoy. [Video Removed for the privacy of my school and students]

Here's my list of reasons why this year's Reddit Gifts for Teachers should be boycotted. Feel free to add comments and I'll edit this post to reflect them.

**Edit 8/2 10:24:** Some people are pointing out that this boycott has no stated goal. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d6196h7) for my response to that.

**Edit 8/2 12:29:** If you are interested in discussing how we can return to and improve the old system, please go to [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d61fjrl).

**Edit 8/2 13:45:** Admin /u/bluepinkblack posted an update thread in /r/teachers, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vumtq/crosspost_from_rsecretsanta_three_things_1/).

1. Recipients are members of DonorsChoose, not necessarily reddit. The pool of teachers donors can choose to support is selected from all DonorsChoose projects, even ones that were made prior to the start of Reddit Gifts for Teachers 2016.

2. For teachers on reddit who wish to benefit from this, they need to make a new project. This is very time-consuming, as it takes a lot of effort to create a project page. DonorsChoose also has to approve it, which can take over a week. Some districts, as teacher /u/TheNightWitch points out, [requires their employees to submit project approvals to THEM, which can take additional weeks, effectively prohibiting them from participating](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d607tbt). As /u/i_love_your_pancake points out, [some US public school districts will not allow their teachers to participate in DonorsChoose at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60jgka?context=3).

3. No teachers outside the United States may participate, per DonorsChoose rules.

4. This event is advertised as a reddit event, but redditors who would donate are not (in my opinion) adequately informed that their donations will not support other redditors.

5. Donors can no longer go shopping for needed supplies. Instead, they just give money to DonorsChoose projects. This makes Reddit Gifts more like Reddit Giftcards.

6. The organizers have stated that running the event as they have in the past was too difficult, hence their partnership with DonorsChoose. This decision seems to eliminate any work on their part, as their role is just linking to a poorly organized DonorsChoose page with no oversight regarding whom redditors are helping.

7. Teachers who receive items through DonorsChoose do not own the items. So, hypothetically, if a teacher gets a project funded this year, then changes schools next year, she cannot take the donated items with her because they belong to the school, per DonorsChoose rules. /u/thejynxed clarifies that DonorsChoose mails the items to the school for administration to open, [who can then redistribute the items as they see fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60tzmb) (e.g., ""this other teacher is needier than you, so we're giving her your project items"").

8. As /u/ClutchDude points out, [DonorsChoose takes a cut of all funded projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60ew82). This equals to about a minimum of $30. So most requests on DonorsChoose trend toward expensive grant-like requests (iPads, Chromebooks, field trips, etc.) and away from essentials (paper, colored pencils, etc.). 

9. Piggybacking on #8, /u/north49er suggests [there might be a kickback from DonorsChoose to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60eee1) since reddit's involvement in this will result in revenue for DonorsChoose. I want to be clear that there is no evidence of a kickback, but this observation highlights a conflict of interest: Does Reddit Gifts serve redditors or DonorsChoose? The admins and mods should be overly transparent in advertising on reddit that the donations for this will almost certainly not go to fellow redditors.

10. DonorsChoose doesn't allow private school teachers to participate, so not even all teachers in the US are served.

11. http://i.imgur.com/5MkPvpk.jpg

12. /u/jgdye points out that [if a redditor donates to a project that does not complete its funding, DonorsChoose may redirect the money to another project not approved by the redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60in4b?context=3).

13. This one is a bit selfish on our end here at /r/teachers, but this partnership with DonorsChoose is going to cause our subreddit to be flooded with spam from non-redditors seeking to use reddit to fund their projects: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vqard/supply_lowincome_students_with_classroom_supplies/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vpa2m/feeling_super_in_first_grade_donorschooseorg/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4w2jeq/help_us_get_health_snacks_only_95_to_go_special/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4wq9ad/not_sure_what_to_do/)

14. /u/Angry_helper points out another unfortunate fact about DonorsChoose: [part-time teachers are ineligible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60no9x). Link to DonorsChoose eligibility page [here](https://help.donorschoose.org/hc/en-us/articles/201938006).

15. /u/canom observes not pairing one donor to one teacher [causes teachers to fight one another for visibility of their project in hopes of being funded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d611zpy).

16. /u/luvdmb36 argues that reddit's partnership with DonorsChoose could result in [too many new projects for DonorsChoose to handle](https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cwxf), causing many DonorsChoose non-redditors to be drowned out by redditors scrambling to make projects. The effects of this would last months after reddit ends its event.

**SUMMARY: Admin /u/bluepinkblack explains [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cefh) that drastic changes were made to the traditional format of Reddit Gifts for Teachers because the task of verifying each teacher was too much. This year they have ""partnered"" with DonorsChoose, and the [official event page](https://www.redditgifts.com/page/teachers-2016/) links to a special [Reddit page on DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) where redditors can donate to teachers. Unlike in the past, however, none of the teachers redditors can donate to are necessarily members of reddit. Redditors are merely redirected to DonorsChoose and asked to donate to teachers outside our community all while being led to believe that redditors will be helping redditors. /r/secretsanta mod /u/TheOpus has explained multiple times that redditors who really care about helping other redditors can find people posting links to their DonorsChoose page over at the [official announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/4vo3s6/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/). However, like the [blog announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/), it is filled with hundreds of people expressing disappointment at how things are being run this year. While there are people posting links to their DonorsChoose pages, there is no organization at all...it's a free-for-all of begging for the attention of donors.**

I guess I should add that there's no need to be shitty to the people involved in organizing this event.

15. /u/canom observes not pairing one donor to one teacher [causes teachers to fight one another for visibility of their project in hopes of being funded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d611zpy).

16. /u/luvdmb36 argues that reddit's partnership with DonorsChoose could result in [too many new projects for DonorsChoose to handle](https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cwxf), causing many DonorsChoose non-redditors to be drowned out by redditors scrambling to make projects. The effects of this would last months after reddit ends its event.

**SUMMARY: Admin /u/bluepinkblack explains [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cefh) that drastic changes were made to the traditional format of Reddit Gifts for Teachers because the task of verifying each teacher was too much. This year they have ""partnered"" with DonorsChoose, and the [official event page](https://www.redditgifts.com/page/teachers-2016/) links to a special [Reddit page on DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) where redditors can donate to teachers. Unlike in the past, however, none of the teachers redditors can donate to are necessarily members of reddit. Redditors are merely redirected to DonorsChoose and asked to donate to teachers outside our community all while being led to believe that redditors will be helping redditors. /r/secretsanta mod /u/TheOpus has explained multiple times that redditors who really care about helping other redditors can find people posting links to their DonorsChoose page over at the [official announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/4vo3s6/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/). However, like the [blog announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/), it is filled with hundreds of people expressing disappointment at how things are being run this year. While there are people posting links to their DonorsChoose pages, there is no organization at all...it's a free-for-all of begging for the attention of donors.**

I guess I should add that there's no need to be shitty to the people involved in organizing this event. We can communicate that it's a horrible decision without berating them.",2,compound,0.8845,2016

No, not every state has strong unions.  And sometimes unions can be overbearing.  But they are your number one protection against getting screwed over, especially if you're in a right to work state.  I'm in Texas and our union negotiated for us to get paid during new hire orientation.  As in, we would not have gotten paid for four 8-hour trainings without the union.  I would not be getting a stipend as a special ed teacher without the union.  They cannot fight for you, on a local and national level, unless they have strong support.

A lot of people offered advice and support-- which I consider to be the most important reason for this sub-- but there were others who once again devolved this into an elementary vs. secondary pissing contest. 

I've taught at both levels for 5 years and have now supervised preservice teachers at both levels for 6 years. Both have tremendous challenges, but also benefits, and it doesn't help to arguing back and forth about it. I'm going to generalize somewhat, but to address the most common arguments:

Elementary people, just because secondary teachers often (but certainly not always!) have less subjects to plan doesn't mean they have it any easier than you do, nor does the fact that older students don't tend to need as much direct supervision as, say, 6 year olds. They also have many more students to be responsible for, and often a lot more grading.

Secondary people, just because the content itself in elementary is easier does not in any way mean it's easier to teach or to plan. Nor does it make elementary teachers any less of professionals. Furthermore, they are not babysitting. Ever. While those who have never been in elementary classrooms may think the teachers have it ""easy"", teaching/facilitating their students' social-emotional growth is literally nonstop and requires a tremendous amount of skill, even if it looks like the students are ""just playing"". Oh yeah, and the upper grades (and in some places, all the grades) have standardized testing as well.

We all face challenges: too little planning time; not enough administrative support; issues with parents; dealing with students' needs; and so on and so forth.

Make sure that you are nice and respectful to the custodial and office staff. These people work extremely hard and they can either make your work life easier or hell. 

Bring some treats in for the office staff and thank them for their hard work. Turn your paperwork in/respond to their emails on time. Do not make them chase you down. Try to give them proper notice when you need a sub. They are miracle workers in many ways but do not act as if you're entitled to a miracle just because you work there. Principals may be in charge but really, the secretaries run the school. You need them on your side. 

My last school had Italian custodians so I didn't get to talk to them because I didn't speak Italian but my first school had a great custodial staff. Talk about a thankless job. These people clean up our and or students messes every day and their work largely goes ignored. I had 4th period planning and my custodian would come in before the bell rang to get a head start and even though I was busy I always made an effort to talk to him. He was the nicest guy and helped me out a lot that year. He was my designated bug killer :) And he legit cleaned my room. Sometimes all it takes is a smile and sincere thank you. 

Same with maintenance staff and IT people. 

A little effort goes a long way!

I've posted this at the beginning of the school year for the past couple years.  Hope it's helpful! 

1. Go with the flow. New teachers are often subject to scrutiny not just by administration, but also by other teachers.  New teachers also are often the ones who want to be the ones to break the mold, to have the fun classroom, to win the Teacher of the Year award and to be the best darn teacher X High School has ever seen.  Fresh out of college, you want to chart your own course, try out some crazy new educational methods you’ve learned, etc. However, you have to be realistic.  Having served on interview committees, I know that (unless you’re specifically told otherwise) schools want teachers who are going to be in line with what they’re already doing.  Terms like “teaming” and “vertical and horizontal alignment” will be thrown around, and the people you work with are going to want you to be a team player.  Simply put, do what the other teachers are doing… Use their lesson plans, do their projects, follow their calendars.This can often take a bit of “grinning and bearing it,” but remember, you’re (hopefully!) in this for the long haul.
	Of course, once you shut the door to your classroom, you’re likely to have tons of freedom to do as you like with the minutiae of your day and you don’t want to be a robot copy of other teachers.  However, when the three other teachers on your Freshman Language Arts team are all discussing the Of Mice and Men papers they had them write, and you’re left talking about the artistic interpretations you did instead, you’re going to tick people off- regardless of whether or not the project was actually a better idea in the first place.  
	Note that this doesn’t mean that you should go overboard.  Many teachers are willing to share their stuff with you, but don’t come off as a sponge or as overly lazy.  I can remember sharing some easy multiple choice quizzes on a novel we were teaching with a new teacher.  Two days later, he came back asking for the keys to the quizzes.  I remember thinking, “Did you even read the book? These are easy, plot based questions.  Why do you need the answer keys?”  
	During your second and third and subsequent years of teaching, you’ll be able to add in your own voice and make suggestions as to how certain aspects of shared curricula can be improved.  For your first year though, let 70-80% of what goes on in your classroom be the same as what’s going on in the other classrooms on your team. 

2. “If You Choose to Waste Your Time, That’s Your Business”  I’ve seen this one tons of times.  The teacher stands up on the first day, tells the class that she’s here to teach, and that the students will learn a lot, but that it’s up to them to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them.  “If you want to sit there and sleep or play on your phone all period, that’s your business. I’m here to teach those who want to learn.” 
	You would think this would work in that it would empower students by giving them the decision to learn.  It doesn’t.  All it does is give unmotivated students the green light to sleep and chatty teenage girls the opportunity to Snapchat all day. Worse yet, if you try to wake the kid up or get the kid to put his cell phone away, you’re going to get a “But you said I could sleep!!!”  And technically, the kid is right. 
Never let kids sleep or use cell phones in your room.  Nothing looks worse to passing administrators or fellow teachers than when they see a teacher teaching in blatant ignorance of half the kids sleeping or texting.  
Remember that you’re the one in charge here.  If a kid is sleeping, wake him up.  If they’re on their phones, take the phones or have the students put them away.  Of course, do so gently but firmly.  Talk to a student to figure out why they’re so tired in your room and try to figure out ways to solve the problem.  But never let kids sleep.
This rule works similarly with time you give students to work.  I’ve seen teachers say things like “I’m giving you all 45 minutes to work, and if you choose to waste your time, that’s your problem.  You can do the assignment at home.”  Some of the kids will just goof off for 45 minutes, and then not do the assignment at home either.  You can’t control what they do at home, but you can control what they do in your classroom.  Set clear expectations for how you expect them to use their time in your class.

3.  Google Yourself.  Do this first, because the students are almost certainly going to do so.  Is your Facebook profile public?  Make it private.  Do you have a Match.com account? Close it, or at least make sure it’s extremely classy.  Do you have an Instagram or Twitter account?  Make them private as well.  Any online presence that is likely to be controversial (Are you pro-marijuana legalization?  Do you think Israel is the real terrorist in the Middle East?) should be erased.  New teachers are often let go at the drop of a hat, and this is a really easy way to find yourself looking for a new job.  Of course, having a pro-marijuana or anti-Israel stance isn’t illegal, but why give yourself that hassle? You wouldn’t think that kids would be lame enough to look for little ‘ol you on Google.  Believe me, they are. Especially if you have a very unique name (looking at you, Preston Kowalcyzk), get rid of everything before they even know who you are. 

4.  “Let’s Talk About This After Class.”  This is one of the best things you can say in a classroom if things ever get heated.  One important thing to remember is this: Students never want to lose face in front of other kids.  If two kids get into an argument, they’re going to keep going until they are stopped by an adult.  If you happen to get into an argument with a student, they’re likely to keep firing back until the situation gets out of hand.  For example, let’s say you call a kid out for talking in your class. A likely response is: “But I wasn’t doing anything.”  The best thing to do in this case would be to probably just move on, but if you chose to fire back with “Yes, you were.  You’ve been talking all period and I’m getting sick of it,” you should prepare for all-out war.  Whenever you notice things beginning to get out of hand, simply say “Let’s talk about this after class” and without waiting for a response from the student, carry on teaching.  
	Face it, you don’t want to lose face in front of a whole class either, but if it keeps going back and forth, your only other option is to send the student out of the room, which is a bad idea (See #5).  When you say “Let’s talk about this after class,” it immediately defuses the situation and nobody loses.  Why not wait for a response?  Because it doesn’t need one.  You’re basically telling the student “we’re moving on.” Also, by waiting for a response, you’re likely to just be asking for some smart alec response from the student.  The quicker you can defuse the situation and get back to normal, the better.  
	
5.  Only let the most serious of problems leave your classroom.  One of the biggest mistakes I made during my student teaching was constantly sending kids to the office.  I thought I was being tough on crime and I thought I was sending a message to my students that I wasn’t messing around.  Looking back though, I was more likely than not just irritating the office staff and making them wonder why the hell I couldn’t control my own classroom.  
	If you’re constantly writing kids up and constantly having kids leave your room for timeout, etc. you’re going to look like a weak teacher in the eyes of the administration.  Your first year is likely to be the worst year of your career for discipline issues, but just ride it out.  Talk to other teachers, observe other classrooms, see how other teachers handle these types of situations. Frankly, a lot of crowd control comes with experience. You’ll get better at it as you go along.  
	That said, there are of course certain things that should not be tolerated.  Students who are violent or a danger to themselves or others should not be allowed in the classroom.  Students who are majorly disruptive to the classroom environment should not be allowed in the classroom.  Use your discretion, though.  If it can be handled in your classroom, handle it there.  Save your “Go Directly to the Office” card for when you really need it. 

6. Show interest.  Schools want first and foremost good teachers, and it’s your good teaching that is going to help you keep your job for your second year.  However, it also helps to take an interest in school events.  Show up at football games.  Go to the school play.  Get your car washed by the swim team when they’re having their annual fundraiser.  Wear your school’s T-shirts out on the weekend.  Be proud to be a part of your community.
	One of the things I’ve noticed in common with teachers who were not asked back after their first or second year (besides the fact that they weren’t great teachers) was that they didn’t really seem interested in the community at all.  I know that in my case, I was an AWFUL teacher my first year.  I made just about every mistake in the book.  I cared, though, and I really think that that was my saving grace.  When I went for my end of the year review, I was able to not just say to the principal that I was a proud member of my school’s community, but I was able to rattle off a list of things that I had taken part in.  My eagerness to really be a part of the community is what kept me hanging on there into my second year.
	Before you think that this is just a cheap political tactic to get points with the admin team, remember that students LOVE it when you show up for things.  I still remember when my freshman year English teacher showed up at the school musical with a flower each for me and another student.  We were just in the chorus and had no major role, but yet, there she was.  That was almost 20 years ago, but I still remember thinking how thoughtful she was to do that.  
	Additionally, it’s awesome to get to see kids in their element.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been amazed at students who were just mediocre in my class, but who were amazing singers, musicians, or athletes.  It’s really cool to see a kid’s other side, and comments like “You were awesome in that game this weekend!” can help to build a bridge with a student that you might not have the best relationship with.  

7.  Set parameters.  My first year of teaching was all work.  I worked at school until 5pm.  I came home and worked some more.  On Saturdays, I worked.  On Sundays, I worked more.  It was awful.  I remember thinking to myself, This is why teachers burn out so quickly!  No wonder.  You have to remember that, as a teacher, there’s ALWAYS more work to be done.  There’s always something to grade, lessons to plan, etc.  	
	About halfway through my first year, I remember talking to a colleague of mine about the workload.  He made a casual, offhand remark, saying “Yeah, I don’t do any work on Saturday. That’s my time.” It’s so simple, but it saved me that first year.  I stopped doing work on Saturday.  This often meant that I spent all day Sunday doing things, but it was worth it.  It was such a great feeling to give myself the freedom to do whatever I wanted on Saturdays without feeling guilty.  
	There’s a million different little ways you can do this, if the Saturday thing doesn’t work.  Maybe it’s no checking emails after 8pm, or leaving right after school on Monday to ease your way back into the week.  Whatever it is, set free time in for yourself and don’t feel guilty about it.

I've posted this at the beginning of the school year for the past couple years.  Hope it's helpful! 

1. Go with the flow. New teachers are often subject to scrutiny not just by administration, but also by other teachers.  New teachers also are often the ones who want to be the ones to break the mold, to have the fun classroom, to win the Teacher of the Year award and to be the best darn teacher X High School has ever seen.  Fresh out of college, you want to chart your own course, try out some crazy new educational methods you’ve learned, etc. However, you have to be realistic.  Having served on interview committees, I know that (unless you’re specifically told otherwise) schools want teachers who are going to be in line with what they’re already doing.  Terms like “teaming” and “vertical and horizontal alignment” will be thrown around, and the people you work with are going to want you to be a team player.  Simply put, do what the other teachers are doing… Use their lesson plans, do their projects, follow their calendars.This can often take a bit of “grinning and bearing it,” but remember, you’re (hopefully!) in this for the long haul.
	Of course, once you shut the door to your classroom, you’re likely to have tons of freedom to do as you like with the minutiae of your day and you don’t want to be a robot copy of other teachers.  However, when the three other teachers on your Freshman Language Arts team are all discussing the Of Mice and Men papers they had them write, and you’re left talking about the artistic interpretations you did instead, you’re going to tick people off- regardless of whether or not the project was actually a better idea in the first place.  
	Note that this doesn’t mean that you should go overboard.  Many teachers are willing to share their stuff with you, but don’t come off as a sponge or as overly lazy.  I can remember sharing some easy multiple choice quizzes on a novel we were teaching with a new teacher.  Two days later, he came back asking for the keys to the quizzes.  I remember thinking, “Did you even read the book? These are easy, plot based questions.  Why do you need the answer keys?”  
	During your second and third and subsequent years of teaching, you’ll be able to add in your own voice and make suggestions as to how certain aspects of shared curricula can be improved.  For your first year though, let 70-80% of what goes on in your classroom be the same as what’s going on in the other classrooms on your team.

I sat in on a middle school Science class today. The teacher had a quiz, with relevant questions, and then followed the quiz with bonus questions, that were supposed to be about current events.

The bonus questions concerned me-- they were mostly about how republicans won the election-- there was an inaccurate electoral map, a picture of Mike Pence the students had to identify, a map of Syria, and an image of some icebergs.

After the quiz, the teacher went over the images and told the students that the all-red election map was how the election actually happened, Mike Pence was a good guy, most people from Syria were somehow related to ISIS, and that climate change was a hoax. This is in a science class, remember.

The quiz concerned me, especially since it was being taught to middle school students. While all of the image-identification was for extra credit-- is this allowed? Should I report it?

I don't want to be getting offended for the wrong reasons-- I'm obviously not republican, and this teacher is obviously very republican, but can a science teacher really be teaching his students this stuff? The political images, and his explanation seemed very propaganda-ish, and the climate change image-- can a science teacher be claiming that its a hoax? He literally used the word 'stupid' when describing it. I was really taken aback, but I held my tongue.

Please be civil, if you disagree with my points of view. Im only asking because I wouldn't want to report someone for having a different political view than I do -- but some of his comments after the quiz stuck me as genuinely wrong, and excessive.

Not sure if it's national, but in my state, there's 180 days of school across the board. That's less than HALF of the year I actually ""work"". Meaning if you randomly generated a day of the year, chances are, I would not be working.

I'm off today for Yom Kippur. Monday was Columbus Day. Two weeks ago, I had a four day weekend for Rosh Hashannah. In three more weeks, there's no school for professional development, and after that, the obvious Thanksgiving Break.

Sure, I got a handful of excellent students, but the rest of the class couldn't care less that I was in the room.  So, I stop.  I stop trying to get their attention, I walk to my desk, sit down and think.  I look at what happens if I'm not in the forefront.  Waiting and watching as the class begins to deteriorate.  Soon enough, a well-vocalized girl walks up to the front and says, ""alright, I'll be your teacher."" And she begins to mock and imitate everything I do.  She broke me.  I couldn't believe it, and I fought hard not to, but I totally broke down.  I felt so helpless, and embarrassed, I couldn't look at that class.

I wasn't bawling, and it wasn't bad, but tears were in my eyes, and it was pretty evident that I evoked an emotional response.  A girl noticed and immediately began to tear up herself, shutting down the whole class.  It fell silent.  A pin could drop and be heard.  The spotlight was on me.  I gathered myself together, gave them my reasoning for responding in tears, while still fighting them back, and I'm pretty sure every girl and a few guys were upset.  They finally discovered that I'm not a robot...I'm a human being.  One student ran out to get a principal, but by that time I had recovered and started teaching my class.  I actually taught them, and they were silent.  They were writing, taking notes, asking questions.  A vice principal sat in for the rest of the class and micro-managed a few students to stay on task, but it was kind of amazing.  I'm not sure if I regret this whole thing.  I don't know how the response will be today, but I'm just going to be me and not let anything disrupt what I want to achieve.  It took them to see me at my worst, to get me at my best.  I can do this.  This is what I am.  This is WHO I am.  I can do this.


EDIT:  Hey All, I just wanted to thank you for your kind words and fellow experiences in the workplace.  It's heartwarming to see such support.  Honestly it's, in a way, more support than my administrators have shown.  Today I saw a slight improvement in the classroom, and when things were going south I had a slew of students on my side helping me maintain the class.  It's not perfect, but I'll take what I can get.  I'll be sure to update you guys with a few more paragraphs later this year hahah.  I have a couple amazing stories as well, maybe I'll write those out soon.  You Rock!  Thank You.

I wanted to share my experiences with you all because I know many of you share my same struggles. I am very introverted and speaking in front of a panel was very difficult. First of all, I want to say thank you to all the teachers who have posted on this subreddit, many of these tips came from all of you! I wanted to give back and share my interview experiences as well; to show that, although it's hard, it's not impossible!! I had eight interviews, but I didn't change my tactics until the 4th interview. In the end, I left the interview process with 2 job offers!

&amp;nbsp;

Interview tips:

* Bring a portfolio with student work from different learners. Use examples to show that you know how to differentiate learning for students. What I put in mine: PBL assignment, real-world project, project that incorporated multiple subjects from 2 different learners (gifted and struggling), differentiated assessments, photos of my classroom, photos showing my hobbies. Can't stress this enough. SO many people go into the interview holding NOTHING!!

* Bring a nice professional folder with interview notes so that you can review while you're waiting for the interview. It really helps to calm your nerves. Also, write down questions that you would like to ask them after the interview. I pulled mine out to ask the questions. Makes you look very prepared and interested in the position. I also put a copy of my resume and letter of interest just in case.

* Practice the interview questions with a friend or by yourself. While driving, I would ask myself questions and practice saying the answers out loud. It really helped to prepare me.

* After each interview, write down questions you remember immediately and write down a revised answer of your previous response.

* Research the school! If you don't know anything about the school, they definitely know! I would slip in information during the interview as I was answering questions. For example, ""I saw on your website that...."" and then relate it to your answer to show that you are indeed a great fit for their school.

* Smile and be really enthusiastic. Show that you really care for the students. Your answers should almost always start with ""Students....""

* Be prepared to talk about lessons!! I wrote down specific lessons I wanted to reference. I had a lesson that didn't go so well (talk about how you improved it), a lesson that helped ALL learners, a lesson that shows how you assess students, and a lesson that shows you know how to differentiate!

* Control the interview! When I started my portfolio (maybe after the 4th interview), I decided not to wait for them to ask for my work. Instead, I took them out when I wanted to show them or reference what I was talking about. In one interview, I didn't take anything out until the very end when they asked me what else I would like to tell them. I busted out my portfolio and showed them everything in there. They were all smiles after that. 

* Talk about a club/activity you would like to create for the school. Ask them about professional growth, meetings, collaborations, etc. They want to know you're interested in being involved!

&amp;nbsp;

Interview Questions I came across:

* Tell me about yourself/tell me about your experiences (always the first question). Don't paraphrase your resume, be genuine, talk about what you've learned through your experiences.

* What are some talents/skills that you can contribute the the school (personal &amp; professional)?

* How do you deal with a difficult/different student? (This question could be a specific scenario question)

* What are your weaknesses/strengths? (Talk about how you might improve upon your weaknesses)

* Describe a lesson that didn't go so well. What did you do? (I think I was asked this almost every interview)

* Describe a lesson you taught, how did you monitor individual progress? (I was also asked this A LOT)

* How do you handle a discipline problem? (This could also be given using a specific scenario)

* Describe a lesson that was difficult for students. What did you do?

* What strategies do you implement to ensure student understanding?

* How do you plan lessons effectively?

* Tell me about your classroom management.

* How do you differentiate lessons?

* What is your teaching philosophy? Your grading philosophy?

* How do you know students are learning? 

* How do you motivate students?

I wanted to share my experiences with you all because I know many of you share my same struggles. I am very introverted and speaking in front of a panel was very difficult. First of all, I want to say thank you to all the teachers who have posted on this subreddit, many of these tips came from all of you! I wanted to give back and share my interview experiences as well; to show that, although it's hard, it's not impossible!! I had eight interviews, but I didn't change my tactics until the 4th interview. In the end, I left the interview process with 2 job offers!

&amp;nbsp;

Interview tips:

* Bring a portfolio with student work from different learners. Use examples to show that you know how to differentiate learning for students. What I put in mine: PBL assignment, real-world project, project that incorporated multiple subjects from 2 different learners (gifted and struggling), differentiated assessments, photos of my classroom, photos showing my hobbies. Can't stress this enough. SO many people go into the interview holding NOTHING!!

* Bring a nice professional folder with interview notes so that you can review while you're waiting for the interview. It really helps to calm your nerves. Also, write down questions that you would like to ask them after the interview. I pulled mine out to ask the questions. Makes you look very prepared and interested in the position. I also put a copy of my resume and letter of interest just in case.

* Practice the interview questions with a friend or by yourself. While driving, I would ask myself questions and practice saying the answers out loud. It really helped to prepare me.

* After each interview, write down questions you remember immediately and write down a revised answer of your previous response.

* Research the school! If you don't know anything about the school, they definitely know! I would slip in information during the interview as I was answering questions. For example, ""I saw on your website that...."" and then relate it to your answer to show that you are indeed a great fit for their school.

* Smile and be really enthusiastic. Show that you really care for the students. Your answers should almost always start with ""Students....""

* Be prepared to talk about lessons!! I wrote down specific lessons I wanted to reference. I had a lesson that didn't go so well (talk about how you improved it), a lesson that helped ALL learners, a lesson that shows how you assess students, and a lesson that shows you know how to differentiate!

* Control the interview! When I started my portfolio (maybe after the 4th interview), I decided not to wait for them to ask for my work. Instead, I took them out when I wanted to show them or reference what I was talking about. In one interview, I didn't take anything out until the very end when they asked me what else I would like to tell them. I busted out my portfolio and showed them everything in there. They were all smiles after that. 

* Talk about a club/activity you would like to create for the school. Ask them about professional growth, meetings, collaborations, etc. They want to know you're interested in being involved!

&amp;nbsp;

Interview Questions I came across:

* Tell me about yourself/tell me about your experiences (always the first question). Don't paraphrase your resume, be genuine, talk about what you've learned through your experiences.

* What are some talents/skills that you can contribute the the school (personal &amp; professional)?

* How do you deal with a difficult/different student? (This question could be a specific scenario question)

* What are your weaknesses/strengths? (Talk about how you might improve upon your weaknesses)

* Describe a lesson that didn't go so well. What did you do? (I think I was asked this almost every interview)

* Describe a lesson you taught, how did you monitor individual progress? (I was also asked this A LOT)

* How do you handle a discipline problem? (This could also be given using a specific scenario)

* Describe a lesson that was difficult for students. What did you do?

* What strategies do you implement to ensure student understanding?

* How do you plan lessons effectively?

* Tell me about your classroom management.

* How do you differentiate lessons?

* What is your teaching philosophy? Your grading philosophy?

* How do you know students are learning? 

* How do you motivate students?

* Why should we hire you? Why are you the best candidate? (Really market yourself here! But, make sure you are showing them how you can help improve the school, carry out their mission!)

I was entering my first year teaching at the high school level. The first day was last week and I had told all of my department members I was going to do it. Some of them even helped set it up.

The day went hilariously.

I wrote up on the board ""INSTRUCTIONS: Introduce yourself to as many people as you can and tell your *best* story!"" I had different coworkers come into my class period at the beginning of each prep and tell the students Mr. Augustane was running late making copies. My students were to begin the activity without me until I arrived.

I wore a hoodie over my dress shirt and tie and brought one of my old backpacks. During the periods I sat down in the seats and introduced myself as the new student named 'Jeremy Lin' and told some of my best stories. Dates and age were changed of course, haha. About 5-10 minutes after introducing myself and hearing several students' stories, I would step to the front of the class and stand on a table, then reveal myself... to the shock of all of my students. It was pretty funny how some students who were quite ~~caddy~~ catty looked when they realized who I was.

In one period in particular, however, I was seated next to a gentleman who proceeded to tell me ""Oh man, this period is going to go APESHIT."" The conversation continued like this:

Him: I had [name], [name], and [name] in my ___ class last year and we ~~wrecked~~ wreaked havoc. We drove that teacher nuts.

Me: Oh. [name], [name], and [name]?

Him: Yeah. They're cool guys. I'm pretty sure we're going to eat this teacher alive.

Me: Why?

Him: He's a first year teacher. They never know what the hell they're doing. All they ever do is stick to the textbook and generally suck.

Me: Do you know anything else about this Mr. Augustane?

Him: No, not really, but he's probably going to be really slow and boring. First year teachers always are. He won't have control of this class. I don't think he'll be any good.


At that moment, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said something along the lines of ""Don't worry buddy, I'm sure I'll do fine."" before stepping up to the class and revealing myself. The class really did go apeshit, but for different reasons. (:

The look on that kid's face was priceless. I was sure to thank him for pointing out all the trouble makers for me afterwards.

By 5th and 6th period, all the students were scanning around trying to figure out where I could've been hiding. They were accusing different Asian students of being the teacher.

Overall it was a great start before laying down the rules and syllabus the following day. I was nervous it was going to be a terrible idea, but now my students won't stop joking about it.

**TL;DR: Pretended to be a student. Found out my trouble makers and sent my students for a loop.**


Edit: Sorry about the title gore. Reddit was automatically capitalizing each of the first letters in my title...then it didn't for some of them?

Edit 2: Best of'd. Terrific. I just wanted to take this moment to remind everyone (especially those who aren't educators) that after this wonderful first day of school, even though I was the talk of the school and my students kept saying how awesome their English teacher was, I still came home and broke down crying for hours. Teaching is a stressful job. I couldn't have done it without the support of my family and coworkers, but not every teacher has that. It doesn't just end with the students in the classroom. We get evaluated, we memorize dozens of personalized learning plans for students with accommodations, and (first year teachers especially) we stay up well past our bedtimes perfecting our lessons. Whether you're in school or not, love your teachers past and present, because we love you.

Edit 3: If you're my student and ran across this… just… don't embarrass me in class. Okay? Okay.

Final Edit: Cat's out of the bag. Kids all know about it. Couple of my coworkers saw it on Reddit. Facebook exploded on me while I was teaching my last period. Guess there's no anonymity left. Enjoy. [Video Removed for the privacy of my school and students]

Here's my list of reasons why this year's Reddit Gifts for Teachers should be boycotted. Feel free to add comments and I'll edit this post to reflect them.

**Edit 8/2 10:24:** Some people are pointing out that this boycott has no stated goal. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d6196h7) for my response to that.

**Edit 8/2 12:29:** If you are interested in discussing how we can return to and improve the old system, please go to [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d61fjrl).

**Edit 8/2 13:45:** Admin /u/bluepinkblack posted an update thread in /r/teachers, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vumtq/crosspost_from_rsecretsanta_three_things_1/).

1. Recipients are members of DonorsChoose, not necessarily reddit. The pool of teachers donors can choose to support is selected from all DonorsChoose projects, even ones that were made prior to the start of Reddit Gifts for Teachers 2016.

2. For teachers on reddit who wish to benefit from this, they need to make a new project. This is very time-consuming, as it takes a lot of effort to create a project page. DonorsChoose also has to approve it, which can take over a week. Some districts, as teacher /u/TheNightWitch points out, [requires their employees to submit project approvals to THEM, which can take additional weeks, effectively prohibiting them from participating](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d607tbt). As /u/i_love_your_pancake points out, [some US public school districts will not allow their teachers to participate in DonorsChoose at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60jgka?context=3).

3. No teachers outside the United States may participate, per DonorsChoose rules.

4. This event is advertised as a reddit event, but redditors who would donate are not (in my opinion) adequately informed that their donations will not support other redditors.

5. Donors can no longer go shopping for needed supplies. Instead, they just give money to DonorsChoose projects. This makes Reddit Gifts more like Reddit Giftcards.

6. The organizers have stated that running the event as they have in the past was too difficult, hence their partnership with DonorsChoose. This decision seems to eliminate any work on their part, as their role is just linking to a poorly organized DonorsChoose page with no oversight regarding whom redditors are helping.

7. Teachers who receive items through DonorsChoose do not own the items. So, hypothetically, if a teacher gets a project funded this year, then changes schools next year, she cannot take the donated items with her because they belong to the school, per DonorsChoose rules. /u/thejynxed clarifies that DonorsChoose mails the items to the school for administration to open, [who can then redistribute the items as they see fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60tzmb) (e.g., ""this other teacher is needier than you, so we're giving her your project items"").

8. As /u/ClutchDude points out, [DonorsChoose takes a cut of all funded projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60ew82). This equals to about a minimum of $30. So most requests on DonorsChoose trend toward expensive grant-like requests (iPads, Chromebooks, field trips, etc.) and away from essentials (paper, colored pencils, etc.). 

9. Piggybacking on #8, /u/north49er suggests [there might be a kickback from DonorsChoose to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60eee1) since reddit's involvement in this will result in revenue for DonorsChoose. I want to be clear that there is no evidence of a kickback, but this observation highlights a conflict of interest: Does Reddit Gifts serve redditors or DonorsChoose? The admins and mods should be overly transparent in advertising on reddit that the donations for this will almost certainly not go to fellow redditors.

10. DonorsChoose doesn't allow private school teachers to participate, so not even all teachers in the US are served.

11. http://i.imgur.com/5MkPvpk.jpg

12. /u/jgdye points out that [if a redditor donates to a project that does not complete its funding, DonorsChoose may redirect the money to another project not approved by the redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60in4b?context=3).

13. This one is a bit selfish on our end here at /r/teachers, but this partnership with DonorsChoose is going to cause our subreddit to be flooded with spam from non-redditors seeking to use reddit to fund their projects: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vqard/supply_lowincome_students_with_classroom_supplies/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vpa2m/feeling_super_in_first_grade_donorschooseorg/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4w2jeq/help_us_get_health_snacks_only_95_to_go_special/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4wq9ad/not_sure_what_to_do/)

14. /u/Angry_helper points out another unfortunate fact about DonorsChoose: [part-time teachers are ineligible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60no9x). Link to DonorsChoose eligibility page [here](https://help.donorschoose.org/hc/en-us/articles/201938006).

15. /u/canom observes not pairing one donor to one teacher [causes teachers to fight one another for visibility of their project in hopes of being funded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d611zpy).

16. /u/luvdmb36 argues that reddit's partnership with DonorsChoose could result in [too many new projects for DonorsChoose to handle](https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cwxf), causing many DonorsChoose non-redditors to be drowned out by redditors scrambling to make projects. The effects of this would last months after reddit ends its event.

**SUMMARY: Admin /u/bluepinkblack explains [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cefh) that drastic changes were made to the traditional format of Reddit Gifts for Teachers because the task of verifying each teacher was too much. This year they have ""partnered"" with DonorsChoose, and the [official event page](https://www.redditgifts.com/page/teachers-2016/) links to a special [Reddit page on DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) where redditors can donate to teachers. Unlike in the past, however, none of the teachers redditors can donate to are necessarily members of reddit. Redditors are merely redirected to DonorsChoose and asked to donate to teachers outside our community all while being led to believe that redditors will be helping redditors. /r/secretsanta mod /u/TheOpus has explained multiple times that redditors who really care about helping other redditors can find people posting links to their DonorsChoose page over at the [official announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/4vo3s6/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/). However, like the [blog announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/), it is filled with hundreds of people expressing disappointment at how things are being run this year.

Here's my list of reasons why this year's Reddit Gifts for Teachers should be boycotted. Feel free to add comments and I'll edit this post to reflect them.

**Edit 8/2 10:24:** Some people are pointing out that this boycott has no stated goal. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d6196h7) for my response to that.

**Edit 8/2 12:29:** If you are interested in discussing how we can return to and improve the old system, please go to [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d61fjrl).

**Edit 8/2 13:45:** Admin /u/bluepinkblack posted an update thread in /r/teachers, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vumtq/crosspost_from_rsecretsanta_three_things_1/).

1. Recipients are members of DonorsChoose, not necessarily reddit. The pool of teachers donors can choose to support is selected from all DonorsChoose projects, even ones that were made prior to the start of Reddit Gifts for Teachers 2016.

2. For teachers on reddit who wish to benefit from this, they need to make a new project. This is very time-consuming, as it takes a lot of effort to create a project page. DonorsChoose also has to approve it, which can take over a week. Some districts, as teacher /u/TheNightWitch points out, [requires their employees to submit project approvals to THEM, which can take additional weeks, effectively prohibiting them from participating](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d607tbt). As /u/i_love_your_pancake points out, [some US public school districts will not allow their teachers to participate in DonorsChoose at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60jgka?context=3).

3. No teachers outside the United States may participate, per DonorsChoose rules.

4. This event is advertised as a reddit event, but redditors who would donate are not (in my opinion) adequately informed that their donations will not support other redditors.

5. Donors can no longer go shopping for needed supplies. Instead, they just give money to DonorsChoose projects. This makes Reddit Gifts more like Reddit Giftcards.

6. The organizers have stated that running the event as they have in the past was too difficult, hence their partnership with DonorsChoose. This decision seems to eliminate any work on their part, as their role is just linking to a poorly organized DonorsChoose page with no oversight regarding whom redditors are helping.

7. Teachers who receive items through DonorsChoose do not own the items. So, hypothetically, if a teacher gets a project funded this year, then changes schools next year, she cannot take the donated items with her because they belong to the school, per DonorsChoose rules. /u/thejynxed clarifies that DonorsChoose mails the items to the school for administration to open, [who can then redistribute the items as they see fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60tzmb) (e.g., ""this other teacher is needier than you, so we're giving her your project items"").

8. As /u/ClutchDude points out, [DonorsChoose takes a cut of all funded projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60ew82). This equals to about a minimum of $30. So most requests on DonorsChoose trend toward expensive grant-like requests (iPads, Chromebooks, field trips, etc.) and away from essentials (paper, colored pencils, etc.). 

9. Piggybacking on #8, /u/north49er suggests [there might be a kickback from DonorsChoose to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60eee1) since reddit's involvement in this will result in revenue for DonorsChoose. I want to be clear that there is no evidence of a kickback, but this observation highlights a conflict of interest: Does Reddit Gifts serve redditors or DonorsChoose? The admins and mods should be overly transparent in advertising on reddit that the donations for this will almost certainly not go to fellow redditors.

10. DonorsChoose doesn't allow private school teachers to participate, so not even all teachers in the US are served.

11. http://i.imgur.com/5MkPvpk.jpg

12. /u/jgdye points out that [if a redditor donates to a project that does not complete its funding, DonorsChoose may redirect the money to another project not approved by the redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d60in4b?context=3).

13. This one is a bit selfish on our end here at /r/teachers, but this partnership with DonorsChoose is going to cause our subreddit to be flooded with spam from non-redditors seeking to use reddit to fund their projects: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vqard/supply_lowincome_students_with_classroom_supplies/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vpa2m/feeling_super_in_first_grade_donorschooseorg/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4w2jeq/help_us_get_health_snacks_only_95_to_go_special/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4wq9ad/not_sure_what_to_do/)

14. /u/Angry_helper points out another unfortunate fact about DonorsChoose: [part-time teachers are ineligible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60no9x). Link to DonorsChoose eligibility page [here](https://help.donorschoose.org/hc/en-us/articles/201938006).

15. /u/canom observes not pairing one donor to one teacher [causes teachers to fight one another for visibility of their project in hopes of being funded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4vq570/boycott_reddit_gifts_for_teachers_donorschoose/d611zpy).

16. /u/luvdmb36 argues that reddit's partnership with DonorsChoose could result in [too many new projects for DonorsChoose to handle](https://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cwxf), causing many DonorsChoose non-redditors to be drowned out by redditors scrambling to make projects. The effects of this would last months after reddit ends its event.

**SUMMARY: Admin /u/bluepinkblack explains [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/d60cefh) that drastic changes were made to the traditional format of Reddit Gifts for Teachers because the task of verifying each teacher was too much. This year they have ""partnered"" with DonorsChoose, and the [official event page](https://www.redditgifts.com/page/teachers-2016/) links to a special [Reddit page on DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) where redditors can donate to teachers. Unlike in the past, however, none of the teachers redditors can donate to are necessarily members of reddit. Redditors are merely redirected to DonorsChoose and asked to donate to teachers outside our community all while being led to believe that redditors will be helping redditors. /r/secretsanta mod /u/TheOpus has explained multiple times that redditors who really care about helping other redditors can find people posting links to their DonorsChoose page over at the [official announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/4vo3s6/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/). However, like the [blog announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/4vo7is/reddit_gifts_for_the_teachers_2016_has_arrived_in/), it is filled with hundreds of people expressing disappointment at how things are being run this year. While there are people posting links to their DonorsChoose pages, there is no organization at all...it's a free-for-all of begging for the attention of donors.**

No, not every state has strong unions.  And sometimes unions can be overbearing.  But they are your number one protection against getting screwed over, especially if you're in a right to work state.

Make sure that you are nice and respectful to the custodial and office staff. These people work extremely hard and they can either make your work life easier or hell. 

Bring some treats in for the office staff and thank them for their hard work. Turn your paperwork in/respond to their emails on time. Do not make them chase you down. Try to give them proper notice when you need a sub. They are miracle workers in many ways but do not act as if you're entitled to a miracle just because you work there. Principals may be in charge but really, the secretaries run the school. You need them on your side. 

My last school had Italian custodians so I didn't get to talk to them because I didn't speak Italian but my first school had a great custodial staff. Talk about a thankless job. These people clean up our and or students messes every day and their work largely goes ignored. I had 4th period planning and my custodian would come in before the bell rang to get a head start and even though I was busy I always made an effort to talk to him. He was the nicest guy and helped me out a lot that year. He was my designated bug killer :) And he legit cleaned my room. Sometimes all it takes is a smile and sincere thank you. 

Same with maintenance staff and IT people. 

A little effort goes a long way!

Try to give them proper notice when you need a sub. They are miracle workers in many ways but do not act as if you're entitled to a miracle just because you work there. Principals may be in charge but really, the secretaries run the school. You need them on your side. 

My last school had Italian custodians so I didn't get to talk to them because I didn't speak Italian but my first school had a great custodial staff. Talk about a thankless job. These people clean up our and or students messes every day and their work largely goes ignored. I had 4th period planning and my custodian would come in before the bell rang to get a head start and even though I was busy I always made an effort to talk to him. He was the nicest guy and helped me out a lot that year. He was my designated bug killer :) And he legit cleaned my room. Sometimes all it takes is a smile and sincere thank you. 

Same with maintenance staff and IT people. 

A little effort goes a long way! 

Edit- I never said you had to *only* be nice to *these* people. Yes, please be professional and respectful to everyone- the world needs more of that. I just wanted to point these individuals out because this has been my personal experience as a teacher. ",134,compound,0.9924,2016

I've posted this at the beginning of the school year for the past couple years.  Hope it's helpful! 

1. Go with the flow. New teachers are often subject to scrutiny not just by administration, but also by other teachers.  New teachers also are often the ones who want to be the ones to break the mold, to have the fun classroom, to win the Teacher of the Year award and to be the best darn teacher X High School has ever seen.  Fresh out of college, you want to chart your own course, try out some crazy new educational methods you’ve learned, etc. However, you have to be realistic.  Having served on interview committees, I know that (unless you’re specifically told otherwise) schools want teachers who are going to be in line with what they’re already doing.  Terms like “teaming” and “vertical and horizontal alignment” will be thrown around, and the people you work with are going to want you to be a team player.  Simply put, do what the other teachers are doing… Use their lesson plans, do their projects, follow their calendars.This can often take a bit of “grinning and bearing it,” but remember, you’re (hopefully!) in this for the long haul.
	Of course, once you shut the door to your classroom, you’re likely to have tons of freedom to do as you like with the minutiae of your day and you don’t want to be a robot copy of other teachers.  However, when the three other teachers on your Freshman Language Arts team are all discussing the Of Mice and Men papers they had them write, and you’re left talking about the artistic interpretations you did instead, you’re going to tick people off- regardless of whether or not the project was actually a better idea in the first place.  
	Note that this doesn’t mean that you should go overboard.  Many teachers are willing to share their stuff with you, but don’t come off as a sponge or as overly lazy.  I can remember sharing some easy multiple choice quizzes on a novel we were teaching with a new teacher.  Two days later, he came back asking for the keys to the quizzes.  I remember thinking, “Did you even read the book? These are easy, plot based questions.  Why do you need the answer keys?”  
	During your second and third and subsequent years of teaching, you’ll be able to add in your own voice and make suggestions as to how certain aspects of shared curricula can be improved.  For your first year though, let 70-80% of what goes on in your classroom be the same as what’s going on in the other classrooms on your team. 

2. “If You Choose to Waste Your Time, That’s Your Business”  I’ve seen this one tons of times.  The teacher stands up on the first day, tells the class that she’s here to teach, and that the students will learn a lot, but that it’s up to them to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them.  “If you want to sit there and sleep or play on your phone all period, that’s your business. I’m here to teach those who want to learn.” 
	You would think this would work in that it would empower students by giving them the decision to learn.  It doesn’t.  All it does is give unmotivated students the green light to sleep and chatty teenage girls the opportunity to Snapchat all day. Worse yet, if you try to wake the kid up or get the kid to put his cell phone away, you’re going to get a “But you said I could sleep!!!”  And technically, the kid is right. 
Never let kids sleep or use cell phones in your room.  Nothing looks worse to passing administrators or fellow teachers than when they see a teacher teaching in blatant ignorance of half the kids sleeping or texting.  
Remember that you’re the one in charge here.  If a kid is sleeping, wake him up.  If they’re on their phones, take the phones or have the students put them away.  Of course, do so gently but firmly.  Talk to a student to figure out why they’re so tired in your room and try to figure out ways to solve the problem.  But never let kids sleep.
This rule works similarly with time you give students to work.  I’ve seen teachers say things like “I’m giving you all 45 minutes to work, and if you choose to waste your time, that’s your problem.  You can do the assignment at home.”  Some of the kids will just goof off for 45 minutes, and then not do the assignment at home either.  You can’t control what they do at home, but you can control what they do in your classroom.  Set clear expectations for how you expect them to use their time in your class.

3.  Google Yourself.  Do this first, because the students are almost certainly going to do so.  Is your Facebook profile public?  Make it private.  Do you have a Match.com account? Close it, or at least make sure it’s extremely classy.  Do you have an Instagram or Twitter account?  Make them private as well.  Any online presence that is likely to be controversial (Are you pro-marijuana legalization?  Do you think Israel is the real terrorist in the Middle East?) should be erased.  New teachers are often let go at the drop of a hat, and this is a really easy way to find yourself looking for a new job.  Of course, having a pro-marijuana or anti-Israel stance isn’t illegal, but why give yourself that hassle? You wouldn’t think that kids would be lame enough to look for little ‘ol you on Google.  Believe me, they are. Especially if you have a very unique name (looking at you, Preston Kowalcyzk), get rid of everything before they even know who you are. 

4.  “Let’s Talk About This After Class.”  This is one of the best things you can say in a classroom if things ever get heated.  One important thing to remember is this: Students never want to lose face in front of other kids.  If two kids get into an argument, they’re going to keep going until they are stopped by an adult.  If you happen to get into an argument with a student, they’re likely to keep firing back until the situation gets out of hand.  For example, let’s say you call a kid out for talking in your class. A likely response is: “But I wasn’t doing anything.”  The best thing to do in this case would be to probably just move on, but if you chose to fire back with “Yes, you were.  You’ve been talking all period and I’m getting sick of it,” you should prepare for all-out war.  Whenever you notice things beginning to get out of hand, simply say “Let’s talk about this after class” and without waiting for a response from the student, carry on teaching.  
	Face it, you don’t want to lose face in front of a whole class either, but if it keeps going back and forth, your only other option is to send the student out of the room, which is a bad idea (See #5).  When you say “Let’s talk about this after class,” it immediately defuses the situation and nobody loses.  Why not wait for a response?  Because it doesn’t need one.  You’re basically telling the student “we’re moving on.” Also, by waiting for a response, you’re likely to just be asking for some smart alec response from the student.  The quicker you can defuse the situation and get back to normal, the better.  
	
5.  Only let the most serious of problems leave your classroom.  One of the biggest mistakes I made during my student teaching was constantly sending kids to the office.  I thought I was being tough on crime and I thought I was sending a message to my students that I wasn’t messing around.  Looking back though, I was more likely than not just irritating the office staff and making them wonder why the hell I couldn’t control my own classroom.  
	If you’re constantly writing kids up and constantly having kids leave your room for timeout, etc. you’re going to look like a weak teacher in the eyes of the administration.  Your first year is likely to be the worst year of your career for discipline issues, but just ride it out.  Talk to other teachers, observe other classrooms, see how other teachers handle these types of situations. Frankly, a lot of crowd control comes with experience. You’ll get better at it as you go along.  
	That said, there are of course certain things that should not be tolerated.  Students who are violent or a danger to themselves or others should not be allowed in the classroom.  Students who are majorly disruptive to the classroom environment should not be allowed in the classroom.  Use your discretion, though.  If it can be handled in your classroom, handle it there.  Save your “Go Directly to the Office” card for when you really need it. 

6. Show interest.  Schools want first and foremost good teachers, and it’s your good teaching that is going to help you keep your job for your second year.  However, it also helps to take an interest in school events.  Show up at football games.  Go to the school play.  Get your car washed by the swim team when they’re having their annual fundraiser.  Wear your school’s T-shirts out on the weekend.  Be proud to be a part of your community.
	One of the things I’ve noticed in common with teachers who were not asked back after their first or second year (besides the fact that they weren’t great teachers) was that they didn’t really seem interested in the community at all.  I know that in my case, I was an AWFUL teacher my first year.  I made just about every mistake in the book.  I cared, though, and I really think that that was my saving grace.  When I went for my end of the year review, I was able to not just say to the principal that I was a proud member of my school’s community, but I was able to rattle off a list of things that I had taken part in.  My eagerness to really be a part of the community is what kept me hanging on there into my second year.
	Before you think that this is just a cheap political tactic to get points with the admin team, remember that students LOVE it when you show up for things.  I still remember when my freshman year English teacher showed up at the school musical with a flower each for me and another student.  We were just in the chorus and had no major role, but yet, there she was.  That was almost 20 years ago, but I still remember thinking how thoughtful she was to do that.  
	Additionally, it’s awesome to get to see kids in their element.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been amazed at students who were just mediocre in my class, but who were amazing singers, musicians, or athletes.  It’s really cool to see a kid’s other side, and comments like “You were awesome in that game this weekend!” can help to build a bridge with a student that you might not have the best relationship with.  

7.  Set parameters.  My first year of teaching was all work.  I worked at school until 5pm.  I came home and worked some more.  On Saturdays, I worked.  On Sundays, I worked more.  It was awful.  I remember thinking to myself, This is why teachers burn out so quickly!  No wonder.  You have to remember that, as a teacher, there’s ALWAYS more work to be done.  There’s always something to grade, lessons to plan, etc.  	
	About halfway through my first year, I remember talking to a colleague of mine about the workload.  He made a casual, offhand remark, saying “Yeah, I don’t do any work on Saturday. That’s my time.” It’s so simple, but it saved me that first year.  I stopped doing work on Saturday.  This often meant that I spent all day Sunday doing things, but it was worth it.  It was such a great feeling to give myself the freedom to do whatever I wanted on Saturdays without feeling guilty.  
	There’s a million different little ways you can do this, if the Saturday thing doesn’t work.  Maybe it’s no checking emails after 8pm, or leaving right after school on Monday to ease your way back into the week.  Whatever it is, set free time in for yourself and don’t feel guilty about it.

I've posted this at the beginning of the school year for the past couple years.  Hope it's helpful! 

1. Go with the flow. New teachers are often subject to scrutiny not just by administration, but also by other teachers.  New teachers also are often the ones who want to be the ones to break the mold, to have the fun classroom, to win the Teacher of the Year award and to be the best darn teacher X High School has ever seen.  Fresh out of college, you want to chart your own course, try out some crazy new educational methods you’ve learned, etc. However, you have to be realistic.  Having served on interview committees, I know that (unless you’re specifically told otherwise) schools want teachers who are going to be in line with what they’re already doing.  Terms like “teaming” and “vertical and horizontal alignment” will be thrown around, and the people you work with are going to want you to be a team player.  Simply put, do what the other teachers are doing… Use their lesson plans, do their projects, follow their calendars.This can often take a bit of “grinning and bearing it,” but remember, you’re (hopefully!) in this for the long haul.
	Of course, once you shut the door to your classroom, you’re likely to have tons of freedom to do as you like with the minutiae of your day and you don’t want to be a robot copy of other teachers.  However, when the three other teachers on your Freshman Language Arts team are all discussing the Of Mice and Men papers they had them write, and you’re left talking about the artistic interpretations you did instead, you’re going to tick people off- regardless of whether or not the project was actually a better idea in the first place.  
	Note that this doesn’t mean that you should go overboard.  Many teachers are willing to share their stuff with you, but don’t come off as a sponge or as overly lazy.  I can remember sharing some easy multiple choice quizzes on a novel we were teaching with a new teacher.  Two days later, he came back asking for the keys to the quizzes.  I remember thinking, “Did you even read the book? These are easy, plot based questions.  Why do you need the answer keys?”  
	During your second and third and subsequent years of teaching, you’ll be able to add in your own voice and make suggestions as to how certain aspects of shared curricula can be improved.  For your first year though, let 70-80% of what goes on in your classroom be the same as what’s going on in the other classrooms on your team. 

2. “If You Choose to Waste Your Time, That’s Your Business”  I’ve seen this one tons of times.  The teacher stands up on the first day, tells the class that she’s here to teach, and that the students will learn a lot, but that it’s up to them to take advantage of the opportunities offered to them.  “If you want to sit there and sleep or play on your phone all period, that’s your business. I’m here to teach those who want to learn.” 
	You would think this would work in that it would empower students by giving them the decision to learn.  It doesn’t.  All it does is give unmotivated students the green light to sleep and chatty teenage girls the opportunity to Snapchat all day. Worse yet, if you try to wake the kid up or get the kid to put his cell phone away, you’re going to get a “But you said I could sleep!!!”  And technically, the kid is right. 
Never let kids sleep or use cell phones in your room.  Nothing looks worse to passing administrators or fellow teachers than when they see a teacher teaching in blatant ignorance of half the kids sleeping or texting.  
Remember that you’re the one in charge here.  If a kid is sleeping, wake him up.  If they’re on their phones, take the phones or have the students put them away.  Of course, do so gently but firmly.  Talk to a student to figure out why they’re so tired in your room and try to figure out ways to solve the problem.  But never let kids sleep.
This rule works similarly with time you give students to work.  I’ve seen teachers say things like “I’m giving you all 45 minutes to work, and if you choose to waste your time, that’s your problem.  You can do the assignment at home.”  Some of the kids will just goof off for 45 minutes, and then not do the assignment at home either.  You can’t control what they do at home, but you can control what they do in your classroom.  Set clear expectations for how you expect them to use their time in your class.

3.  Google Yourself.  Do this first, because the students are almost certainly going to do so.  Is your Facebook profile public?  Make it private.  Do you have a Match.com account? Close it, or at least make sure it’s extremely classy.  Do you have an Instagram or Twitter account?  Make them private as well.  Any online presence that is likely to be controversial (Are you pro-marijuana legalization?  Do you think Israel is the real terrorist in the Middle East?) should be erased.  New teachers are often let go at the drop of a hat, and this is a really easy way to find yourself looking for a new job.  Of course, having a pro-marijuana or anti-Israel stance isn’t illegal, but why give yourself that hassle? You wouldn’t think that kids would be lame enough to look for little ‘ol you on Google.  Believe me, they are. Especially if you have a very unique name (looking at you, Preston Kowalcyzk), get rid of everything before they even know who you are. 

4.  “Let’s Talk About This After Class.”  This is one of the best things you can say in a classroom if things ever get heated.  One important thing to remember is this: Students never want to lose face in front of other kids.  If two kids get into an argument, they’re going to keep going until they are stopped by an adult.  If you happen to get into an argument with a student, they’re likely to keep firing back until the situation gets out of hand.  For example, let’s say you call a kid out for talking in your class. A likely response is: “But I wasn’t doing anything.”  The best thing to do in this case would be to probably just move on, but if you chose to fire back with “Yes, you were.  You’ve been talking all period and I’m getting sick of it,” you should prepare for all-out war.  Whenever you notice things beginning to get out of hand, simply say “Let’s talk about this after class” and without waiting for a response from the student, carry on teaching.  
	Face it, you don’t want to lose face in front of a whole class either, but if it keeps going back and forth, your only other option is to send the student out of the room, which is a bad idea (See #5).  When you say “Let’s talk about this after class,” it immediately defuses the situation and nobody loses.  Why not wait for a response?  Because it doesn’t need one.  You’re basically telling the student “we’re moving on.” Also, by waiting for a response, you’re likely to just be asking for some smart alec response from the student.  The quicker you can defuse the situation and get back to normal, the better.  
	
5.  Only let the most serious of problems leave your classroom.  One of the biggest mistakes I made during my student teaching was constantly sending kids to the office.  I thought I was being tough on crime and I thought I was sending a message to my students that I wasn’t messing around.

I remember how embarrassing that would have been at 13, especially with girls in the class, so I instinctively said ""my bad."" At 30 years old, I obviously have no concern with my social status in 8th grade. Everyone laughed and complained about the smell. I just told them that's what happens when you get old. 

Kid played it cool, and I took the heat. As he was leaving he gave me a little smirk, which is more than I've gotten out of him thus far. Hopefully tomorrow is a good day with him. Time will tell.

He already has gang ties, but at 13 I know there is still hope for him. Today, he accidentally farted. It was not quiet! I remember how embarrassing that would have been at 13, especially with girls in the class, so I instinctively said ""my bad."" At 30 years old, I obviously have no concern with my social status in 8th grade. Everyone laughed and complained about the smell. I just told them that's what happens when you get old. 

Kid played it cool, and I took the heat. As he was leaving he gave me a little smirk, which is more than I've gotten out of him thus far. Hopefully tomorrow is a good day with him. Time will tell.

Not sure if it's national, but in my state, there's 180 days of school across the board. That's less than HALF of the year I actually ""work"". Meaning if you randomly generated a day of the year, chances are, I would not be working.

I'm off today for Yom Kippur. Monday was Columbus Day. Two weeks ago, I had a four day weekend for Rosh Hashannah. In three more weeks, there's no school for professional development, and after that, the obvious Thanksgiving Break.

There have been years in the past in which I NEVER worked more than 3 weeks straight without a professional development day, report card conference day, snow day, or federal holiday on which I was off (no I don't consider PD ""working""). 

Sure, I mostly grade and do lessons on my day off, but when you can sleep in, drink beer, watch TV, and sit in your PJs all day, it hardly seems like work. Even if I didn't have ""homework"" like a lot of other professions, I doubt I'd even want to play video games and read for 16 hours straight on weekends.

Even on days I work, kids come in at 8:30 and leave at 3:09. I have a one hour prep and a 30 minute lunch, meaning I only work for 5 hours a day. Don't get me wrong either - I'm in a low income inner city school and have some extremely challenging students, but no matter how hard it gets, I don't think it's any worse than any other profession I could be doing.

When people say ""You're so lucky to have summers off!"" I say fuck yeah and talk about all of the great things I did last summer. I know a lot of teachers argue ""Well, we do a lot of work then too!"" but I wholly embrace how lucky we are to have the schedule we do.

Sure, I got a handful of excellent students, but the rest of the class couldn't care less that I was in the room.  So, I stop.  I stop trying to get their attention, I walk to my desk, sit down and think.  I look at what happens if I'm not in the forefront.  Waiting and watching as the class begins to deteriorate.  Soon enough, a well-vocalized girl walks up to the front and says, ""alright, I'll be your teacher."" And she begins to mock and imitate everything I do.  She broke me.  I couldn't believe it, and I fought hard not to, but I totally broke down.  I felt so helpless, and embarrassed, I couldn't look at that class.

I wasn't bawling, and it wasn't bad, but tears were in my eyes, and it was pretty evident that I evoked an emotional response.  A girl noticed and immediately began to tear up herself, shutting down the whole class.  It fell silent.  A pin could drop and be heard.  The spotlight was on me.  I gathered myself together, gave them my reasoning for responding in tears, while still fighting them back, and I'm pretty sure every girl and a few guys were upset.  They finally discovered that I'm not a robot...I'm a human being.  One student ran out to get a principal, but by that time I had recovered and started teaching my class.  I actually taught them, and they were silent.  They were writing, taking notes, asking questions.  A vice principal sat in for the rest of the class and micro-managed a few students to stay on task, but it was kind of amazing.  I'm not sure if I regret this whole thing.  I don't know how the response will be today, but I'm just going to be me and not let anything disrupt what I want to achieve.  It took them to see me at my worst, to get me at my best.  I can do this.  This is what I am.  This is WHO I am.  I can do this.


EDIT:  Hey All, I just wanted to thank you for your kind words and fellow experiences in the workplace.  It's heartwarming to see such support.  Honestly it's, in a way, more support than my administrators have shown.  Today I saw a slight improvement in the classroom, and when things were going south I had a slew of students on my side helping me maintain the class.  It's not perfect, but I'll take what I can get.  I'll be sure to update you guys with a few more paragraphs later this year hahah.  I have a couple amazing stories as well, maybe I'll write those out soon.  You Rock!  Thank You.

I wanted to share my experiences with you all because I know many of you share my same struggles. I am very introverted and speaking in front of a panel was very difficult. First of all, I want to say thank you to all the teachers who have posted on this subreddit, many of these tips came from all of you! I wanted to give back and share my interview experiences as well; to show that, although it's hard, it's not impossible!! I had eight interviews, but I didn't change my tactics until the 4th interview. In the end, I left the interview process with 2 job offers!

&amp;nbsp;

Interview tips:

* Bring a portfolio with student work from different learners. Use examples to show that you know how to differentiate learning for students. What I put in mine: PBL assignment, real-world project, project that incorporated multiple subjects from 2 different learners (gifted and struggling), differentiated assessments, photos of my classroom, photos showing my hobbies. Can't stress this enough. SO many people go into the interview holding NOTHING!!

* Bring a nice professional folder with interview notes so that you can review while you're waiting for the interview. It really helps to calm your nerves. Also, write down questions that you would like to ask them after the interview. I pulled mine out to ask the questions. Makes you look very prepared and interested in the position. I also put a copy of my resume and letter of interest just in case.

* Practice the interview questions with a friend or by yourself. While driving, I would ask myself questions and practice saying the answers out loud. It really helped to prepare me.

* After each interview, write down questions you remember immediately and write down a revised answer of your previous response.

* Research the school! If you don't know anything about the school, they definitely know! I would slip in information during the interview as I was answering questions. For example, ""I saw on your website that...."" and then relate it to your answer to show that you are indeed a great fit for their school.

* Smile and be really enthusiastic. Show that you really care for the students. Your answers should almost always start with ""Students....""

* Be prepared to talk about lessons!! I wrote down specific lessons I wanted to reference. I had a lesson that didn't go so well (talk about how you improved it), a lesson that helped ALL learners, a lesson that shows how you assess students, and a lesson that shows you know how to differentiate!

* Control the interview! When I started my portfolio (maybe after the 4th interview), I decided not to wait for them to ask for my work. Instead, I took them out when I wanted to show them or reference what I was talking about. In one interview, I didn't take anything out until the very end when they asked me what else I would like to tell them. I busted out my portfolio and showed them everything in there. They were all smiles after that. 

* Talk about a club/activity you would like to create for the school. Ask them about professional growth, meetings, collaborations, etc. They want to know you're interested in being involved!

&amp;nbsp;

Interview Questions I came across:

* Tell me about yourself/tell me about your experiences (always the first question). Don't paraphrase your resume, be genuine, talk about what you've learned through your experiences.

* What are some talents/skills that you can contribute the the school (personal &amp; professional)?

* How do you deal with a difficult/different student? (This question could be a specific scenario question)

* What are your weaknesses/strengths? (Talk about how you might improve upon your weaknesses)

* Describe a lesson that didn't go so well. What did you do? (I think I was asked this almost every interview)

* Describe a lesson you taught, how did you monitor individual progress? (I was also asked this A LOT)

* How do you handle a discipline problem? (This could also be given using a specific scenario)

* Describe a lesson that was difficult for students. What did you do?

* What strategies do you implement to ensure student understanding?

* How do you plan lessons effectively?

* Tell me about your classroom management.

* How do you differentiate lessons?

* What is your teaching philosophy? Your grading philosophy?

* How do you know students are learning? 

* How do you motivate students?

* Why should we hire you? Why are you the best candidate? (Really market yourself here! But, make sure you are showing them how you can help improve the school, carry out their mission!)

&amp;nbsp;

Please let me know if you would like any more info! I am happy to help!! Also, I did pick up ""Ace Your Teacher Interview"" by Anthony Fredericks. It really helped to provide ideas on how to answer interview questions. But again, the answer to these questions need to be very personalized!

I'm a second year teacher in California who was educated for 18 years in a foreign country, and this post is a call to arms about how we view the first year of teaching.

It is very common on this sub to have first year teachers who are lost, miserable and terrified. They may have put huge amounts of effort and money into becoming a teacher and they find the job is killing them. My heart goes out to these people; as a first year teacher last year, I was definitely very, very busy (average 65 hours per week), but I was in control; I'm fairly lucky - I'm in a great school, went to a great teacher prep programme, and I'm 29 and more able to handle adult responsibilities than a 22 year-old who has never had a real job before.

Frankly, it makes me sick to not only see so many people who are not so lucky, but to see so many just say ""Well that's the first year for you"" - why exactly must it be this way? 

There is something very wrong with that, in my opinion. To expect people to work more than 50% longer hours than they're paid for while they ""learn by doing"", where they may be mostly alone, or worse, in a hostile work environment, seems like a grossly unfair imposition. What other professions make new recruits do that? Serious question, do other countries do that to their teachers (I don't know)? Is a police officer fresh out of the academy put on the beat with no help and expected to handle every situation which may happen? Is a new doctor who hasn't yet been granted their full medical license allowed to practice medicine independently? 

Why aren't there more realistic and fair procedures in place? Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if, as part of (say) a 3-5 year teacher training course, year one was mostly student teaching and classes, and as you went on, you took on more and more responsibility, fewer classes at college and more classes teaching (and getting paid commensurately with your workload), etc, until you were full-fledged?

It isn't fair to the students either, to be saddled with an inexperienced teacher so burdened that they can't give each class their best. As a student teacher I had only 1 class per day, so I could devote a great deal of time and thought to how I wanted it to go. Last year I had 5 classes in 2 different subjects, one of which *I haven't even been formally educated in since I was 14* (but still expected/allowed to teach), and I know I did a worse job than the year before. It would have been great if I'd had a transition year where I had maybe 50% of the workload I have now.

I'm a second year teacher in California who was educated for 18 years in a foreign country, and this post is a call to arms about how we view the first year of teaching.

It is very common on this sub to have first year teachers who are lost, miserable and terrified. They may have put huge amounts of effort and money into becoming a teacher and they find the job is killing them. My heart goes out to these people; as a first year teacher last year, I was definitely very, very busy (average 65 hours per week), but I was in control; I'm fairly lucky - I'm in a great school, went to a great teacher prep programme, and I'm 29 and more able to handle adult responsibilities than a 22 year-old who has never had a real job before.

Frankly, it makes me sick to not only see so many people who are not so lucky, but to see so many just say ""Well that's the first year for you"" - why exactly must it be this way? 

There is something very wrong with that, in my opinion. To expect people to work more than 50% longer hours than they're paid for while they ""learn by doing"", where they may be mostly alone, or worse, in a hostile work environment, seems like a grossly unfair imposition. What other professions make new recruits do that? Serious question, do other countries do that to their teachers (I don't know)? Is a police officer fresh out of the academy put on the beat with no help and expected to handle every situation which may happen? Is a new doctor who hasn't yet been granted their full medical license allowed to practice medicine independently? 

Why aren't there more realistic and fair procedures in place? Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if, as part of (say) a 3-5 year teacher training course, year one was mostly student teaching and classes, and as you went on, you took on more and more responsibility, fewer classes at college and more classes teaching (and getting paid commensurately with your workload), etc, until you were full-fledged?

I'm 6'4"", a bigger guy, and I'm young.  Yesterday, I went to front of the room to start my lesson, and I tried numerous times to get my class's attention.  Nothing worked.  Sure, I got a handful of excellent students, but the rest of the class couldn't care less that I was in the room.  So, I stop.  I stop trying to get their attention, I walk to my desk, sit down and think.  I look at what happens if I'm not in the forefront.  Waiting and watching as the class begins to deteriorate.  Soon enough, a well-vocalized girl walks up to the front and says, ""alright, I'll be your teacher."" And she begins to mock and imitate everything I do.  She broke me.  I couldn't believe it, and I fought hard not to, but I totally broke down.  I felt so helpless, and embarrassed, I couldn't look at that class.

I wasn't bawling, and it wasn't bad, but tears were in my eyes, and it was pretty evident that I evoked an emotional response.  A girl noticed and immediately began to tear up herself, shutting down the whole class.  It fell silent.  A pin could drop and be heard.  The spotlight was on me.  I gathered myself together, gave them my reasoning for responding in tears, while still fighting them back, and I'm pretty sure every girl and a few guys were upset.  They finally discovered that I'm not a robot...I'm a human being.  One student ran out to get a principal, but by that time I had recovered and started teaching my class.  I actually taught them, and they were silent.  They were writing, taking notes, asking questions.  A vice principal sat in for the rest of the class and micro-managed a few students to stay on task, but it was kind of amazing.  I'm not sure if I regret this whole thing.  I don't know how the response will be today, but I'm just going to be me and not let anything disrupt what I want to achieve.  It took them to see me at my worst, to get me at my best.  I can do this.  This is what I am.  This is WHO I am.  I can do this.


EDIT:  Hey All, I just wanted to thank you for your kind words and fellow experiences in the workplace.  It's heartwarming to see such support.  Honestly it's, in a way, more support than my administrators have shown.  Today I saw a slight improvement in the classroom, and when things were going south I had a slew of students on my side helping me maintain the class.  It's not perfect, but I'll take what I can get.  I'll be sure to update you guys with a few more paragraphs later this year hahah.  I have a couple amazing stories as well, maybe I'll write those out soon.  You Rock!  Thank You.

The rules of **Secret Service** are as follows:  
  
- The line leader is the President. The rest of the line is the Secret Service. We must transport the President through the hallways to and from our classroom (the White House) without blowing his/her cover. If we make noise or fail to walk in a straight line, the President's cover is blown.  
- The Secret Service must also be very alert to danger, so I look at one random object between our destinations and keep it a secret. Whenever we reach our destination, I allow a couple of students to guess what the object was. If they guess correctly, the class wins (insert class incentive here, we have class vs teacher points so we use that). If they guess incorrectly, nothing happens.  
- If the President's cover is not blown throughout the week, I allow them to have free-time on the computers in the computer lab for 10 minutes on Friday (use whatever incentive you like).

I'm visiting with my co-workers too much during my off period or lunch. I'm not going to extra-curricular activities to see my students. I'm not teaching them enough. I'm not -engaging- enough. 

As I was discussing this with a fellow teacher, I realized the very root of my discontent is that I don't feel like I'm engaging them enough. My lessons aren't always ""fun."" I don't always have sparkle, piazza, videos, audio, ""cool"" real world examples. I feel like I'm failing my students because my class isn't always fun. I find this to be very concerning. 

Contrary to what the education ""gods"" want us to believe, learning isn't always fun. It can be tedious, it can be challenging, it can be disheartening, but still, one can learn from these feelings. 

For example, we want students to have the ability to read and comprehend at much higher levels than where they currently reside. Yet, every lesson is supposed to incorporate audio versions of the text. When students take the all-knowing standardized tests, there won't be an audio version. What happens then? I'll tell you what happens, they do poorly on the test then feel discouraged and disgusted with education. I see it happen constantly. 

Just this week, I gave my students an ACT practice test. Everyone of my 80 juniors failed it. Every. Last. One. The curriculum we are mandated to use has us put on a dog and pony show when students are ""reading"" a text. Either I'm reading it for them, they're listening to an audio, or they're reading it in a group. They are rarely asked to read anything independently. And they have been conditioned to have everything given to them, so when they are asked to do that, they can't. If I read the text and then ask them the same questions they were asked when they read independently? They can answer it, no problem. 

There's a problem here. This ""engaging"" lesson has gone too far. I feel pressure constantly to do better, be better, do more...yet I'm giving EVERYTHING I have to this job. There's a serious discontent among students and teachers and it's heartbreaking. I often tell myself I'm going to find another career, yet I can't think of anything else I want to do.

Longer, probably, due to the holiday break.

After asking his classmates each day if they'd heard from A, I started asking other teachers. Heard some rumors that A had gone missing. Why hadn't I been told? I'm his homeroom teacher - basically his school mom!

I called his dad immediately. His dad confirmed what I'd heard: that A had been missing for well over a week. A's dad admitted that he'd found a gun in A's room, told him to get rid of it, and A had vanished. A's dad was very emotional, begging me to help; ""I don't know what to do, he won't talk to me, I don't know where he is, am I a bad parent?""

I told him that I couldn't speak to whether he was a bad parent or not, but that kids with good parents, bad parents, average parents . . . they all have the potential to run away. I asked him if he'd called the police at all. He said he didn't.

While still on the phone with A's dad, I emailed the admin, requesting an emergency meeting that second. As soon as I got off the phone with A's dad, I went to admin and security/dean of students, who then phoned the police; they also called the dad and told him to call the police as well.

A returned to school this morning. He sheepishly admitted to me that he forgot his locker combo and I looked it up for him. I said nothing about his absence other than to be all ""Oh hey! It's awesome to see you!""

My biggest fear as a teacher is to be told one of my students is dead. I did everything I could to make sure that didn't happen. Remember your role as mandated reporter.

The week before winter break was Hell Week for me. Up until that point, I thought I was surviving pretty well for a first year teacher. I hadn't cried once, or had a mental breakdown. I *was* losing sleep due to anxiety, but that was a preexisting condition that got worse when I started. Overall, I felt like I was exactly where I needed to be, or at least somewhere close to it. My biggest issue is classroom management.  

Then the week before break, my students turned into complete turds. Every single one of them, even the kids who are normally mild. They just were not having it anymore. Second day of the week, I ended up sending an 8th grade girl to the office because her attitude was getting heated. She wasn't in trouble, I just told her to go to the office to cool off. As she left the room she practically yelled, ""whatever I don't want to be in this fucking class anyway"". Without being able to stop myself, I replied with, ""oh so you want to use 'fucking' at me now??"" The rest of the class went silent. I sat down because I didn't want them to see that I was shaking. I didn't know what to do so I sat and fumbled with things at my desk until I could think of what to do. It took about 2-3 minutes to compose myself. I apologized to my students immediately. I stood up and told them, ""guys, I am sorry for using that word. I lost my cool, and that was not very professional of me. It won't happen again, and I hope you don't think that reflects me as a person."" One kid tried to make me feel better by saying, ""I mean that's what she gets for talking to a teacher like that."" It secretly made me feel a little better, but I knew I had messed up. I held it together until the final bell. I asked the last student out to shut off the lights. And then I hid behind my desk and had a breakdown. In the end it was resolved with admins, they basically said, ""okay you know what you did was wrong, it's a big deal but not a big deal, just move on."" I wish that was where it ended. 

Then, two days later, word had gotten around about that incident. My other 8th grade class was my biggest class. They are also my most talkative/rowdy. In a span of about 5 minutes, 3 separate pairs of students decided to tackle each other (each while I was talking to the others about their behavior), I had to stop a fight between a boy and a girl who wasn't even in my class because he had run into the hallway specifically to call her a bitch. It was like a scene out of *Mean Girls* when Cady has daydreams of her fellow classmates acting like wild animals. I had to call in the teacher next door to help me calm the chaos. At one point, the whole class started chanting and *literally* standing on their chairs and turning over desks. Complete loss of control. I held back the main culprits after school. I had sent an email to the whole staff saying I needed an admin or someone in my room immediately. A few teachers arrived because the students were still being hostile. Then one of them tried to start saying that I cussed out the whole class, and that I was a terrible teacher, and how dare they give someone a job who cusses out a whole class of children. Obviously he had heard the news from two days before. It was also wildly untrue.  

I explained the whole thing to my principal, and he said that he understood and would deal with those kids the next day.  

Finally, on Friday before break, my principal comes up to me and tells me he talked to the kids. Then he tells me that *two of them* decided to say that I cussed at them. I told him that was absolutely not true, and reminded him that it happened that one time and I had learned my lesson. Never again. But getting to the point: it made me **incredibly** infuriated that these students would lie about me just so they could take some of the blame off of themselves. I have a high threshhold for taking a mental beating from students, but that was my tipping point. I immediately requested that they be taken out of my class. They were disruptive, had less than 20% in my class, and on a normal day I could not get through a lesson because of their incessant talking and walking around the classroom and not doing anything I asked them to do. I was willing to put up with all of that stuff, but I refuse to have my integrity questioned even for a second. I owned up to it when I messed up.  

By the end of the week, I felt like I had been repeatedly hit by a mack truck. I felt like giving up. I seriously considered calling it quits; I figured my students didn't care about my subject anyway, so what was the point? I was hopeless. But then I realized that was super unreliable and not best for my students, not to mention selfish, so I had resolved to at least stay until the end of the year. Over the break I decided that since I was staying, I might as well re-do my classroom management plan to try to make it easier.  

I treated the whole first week back last week as the first day of school. I went over the rules extensively, explained my reasoning, asked them to write down why rules exist and then their personal reasons for following the rules. Every single kid said things like, ""because we have to,"" or ""it's the right hing to do,"" and even ""so everyone is safe and there isn't chaos"". Every single student knew exactly the prupose of rules and the value of following them. The rest of the week, instead of punishing a kid, I would look at them and say, ""is that the best choice to make right now? What is an appropriate thing to be doing right now?"" When they gave me the right answer, I said, ""I knew you knew the right thing! Good job!""  

It is like stepping into a whole new classroom. Last week and so far this week has been my longest string of days in a row that I have not had a stress headache. I feel refreshed. I have gotten a healthy amount of sleep without waking up throughout the night. I know I will have to tweak things again when they get back into the swing of school, but this feels awesome. I have gotten through my intended lessons with minimal stoppage due to disruptions. I feel like a competent teacher, instead of just kind of flailing around. I realize now that I wasn't doing very well first semester, but I intend to change that completely this semester. I even have changed my mind and want to give next year (and beyond) another try, if they want me back!

I know this is a long post, but I see so many hard times being had by others, I wanted to post a success story.  

**tl;dr I had *the* worst week of my year so far right before winter break. Used the ""F"" word in class, and even though I apologized and made it right with the admins, my other classes caught wind and used it against me. Felt like quitting on the spot. Over break I composed my thoughts, re-vamped my Classroom Management plan, and gave it another go. Now it feels like I am teaching a whole different set of students. I feel like an actual competent teacher, and I have been reminded why I wanted to teach in the first place.**

She claims that Anna is throwing up every morning before school, and that she thinks it's due to anxiety about school. I can understand the concern regarding her daughter, but I can also testify that Anna is the least stressed kid I have ever met. She's happy, funny, and very smart.

About 2 minutes later she comes in while we're all taking the quiz. She asked for one and I told her no because she was playing in the halls.

She blew up and through her notebook, screaming that I'm fucking with her grades, asking why she cant take it while everyone else is. I had her leave the room and ultimately, I gave her a zero.

About 2 minutes later she comes in while we're all taking the quiz. She asked for one and I told her no because she was playing in the halls.

She blew up and through her notebook, screaming that I'm fucking with her grades, asking why she cant take it while everyone else is. I had her leave the room and ultimately, I gave her a zero.

I never got bullied growing up (wasn't really a thing at my school), but since coming to the city, it's been rough.

Last year, I was eaten alive and totally blindsided by how bad schools could be. I got regularly harassed, threatened, and intimidated by a handful of students. If you've worked in an inner city school, you know that admin and parent support is rarely there, so it was usually me writing an unanswered referral and leaving a voicemail on a probably incorrect phone number or hearing ""ok I'll talk to him"" and end of story.

This year has been a lot better. I came to a slightly better city school and have had a very positive relationship with most of my students. Even the bad kids I can joke with and have a good rap with. However, we've had a few disciplinary transfers since Christmas break and they're all being thrown into one class. Today, they started messing with me and I felt like it created a mob mentality.

It started while we were testing, so the room was quiet. One of the new kids said something about how my shoes were squeaking too loud because they were cheap. I told him if he had a problem then deal with it or take the test next door. He then made a comment about how all of my clothes are cheap, and asked his friend for confirmation, who then joined in too. So now I have two kids making fun of my clothes while the rest of the class is testing, as I'm going through the standard consequences for talking while testing.

I told the instigator he needed to finish his test elsewhere or I'd need to call home, to which he responded ""fuck off"". I immediately took out my phone to call on the spot, and another, normally ok kid, decides to join in and says something along the lines of ""You can't even control your class. You need to call everyone's mom. You're not even a real teacher"". This pisses me off but I pretend not to hear it, as the phone rings. No answer/voicemail so the harassment continues.

Another kid took out his phone during all of this and started blasting music. I told him to put it away or he'd be getting another referral (his home life is a wreck so calling doesn't do anything). He refused and put it on speaker. I warned him again, then he said ""Only if you say pretty please."" I told him he'd need to take the referral and ignored him as I taught, him shouting several times ""Yo, you want me to turn this down? Yo is this annoying you?"" At this point, I have 4 kids in the room straight bullying me - making fun of my clothes, my ability as a teacher, taunting me, etc.

They eventually stopped and seemed to feel bad for me later in the day, which made me feel even shittier about my life.

Today is Thursday.

I'm a 7th grade ELA teacher and was giving a lesson to my 3rd period class of 24 students explaining the 4 types of sentence structures and how clauses play a role in differentiating between sentence types. 

Before class started, a student showed me the video another student took of me, without my knowledge, using his iPad in-class during groupwork. He was yelling PENIS as loud as possible but it was still barely discernible above the din of the classroom so I didn't hear it and I didn't discipline him on the spot. I called out this student the day before this incident for turning in shoddy work that was supposed to be a full, well-written and revised paragraph about Anne Frank. The question had asked him to reflect how he would feel and how he would act if he were in Anne's situation. He responded to that question with: 

&gt; I would survive because I am more mature now. I also would survive because of how much of a pimp I am now. 

This student pulled the fire alarm, along with his buddy, last trimester to boot. Needless to say, I think sending him down to the principal's office and having them formally tell him, and probably his parents,  how he violated our school's policies was the least I could do to get him trouble. 

During my obersvation lesson, so right after I had just learned about this videotaping incident from this other student, there was another, more hurtful incident that occured. 

Another student in the same 3rd period class, while my principal was in the room, commented loudly to his friends around him:

&gt; How insecure does Mr. X have to be to be sweating like that?

To be fair, I was sweating down my nose because grammar is my hardest thing I'm learning how to instruct to kid's in class right now. This was honestly the first grammar lesson of the trimester too, so I was extra nervous. To add context to make others realize I'm just an idiot adult who doesn't know grammar, I was a HS social studies teacher throughout my student teaching and NEVER have taught English before. I don't even have the proper credential for it in this state, but the school hired me anyways knowing full well that that was the case. 

Anyways, back to the story. The kid said that comment about how insecure I was right at the worst possible time because I was about to have them transition to their next activity. My principal was noticing how clearly nervous I was during the lesson and I just felt even more nervous about him noticing how nervous I was. 


I'm 28. I'm a young-looking, but pretty tall and imposing, guy. I am a very kind teacher, maybe too kind, which has gotten me into a position where now I feel like some students feel like they can run all over me. And that is just not going to fly with me. Period. 

What types of thoughts should I be reflecting on right now, what actions should I take to restore maturity, respect and concerted effort towards mutual classroom goals?

Thanks fellow under-appreciated and overworked people in this sphere for any and all comments. We all rock. 


**EDIT:** I talked to my principal and admin today and it was actually a relief. Faith restored. The admin took care of the boys, sorted their shit (which is awesome), wrote behavior contracts for both of them and let me know that I did the right thing coming to them and that that was a kinda crazy occurrence. 

The debrief with my principal went great I think. I don't really have much faith I'll ever get a job at the school again because they may just want a more experienced teacher, but I left the meeting feeling confident I asked the right questions, showed that I was listening to feedback he was giving and committed to keep growing with an open mind.

Should I quit before I get fired or burn out? I did EXCELLENT in my student teaching, I should mention, in a less difficult setting. I am still confident I can be a good teacher, but I feel my relationship with these kids is too far damaged now. ",263,compound,-0.9335,2016

I love my job at my school, but the pay and benefits are not great at all. The school also does not teach Common Core or do much professional development, and I feel that I might be falling behind if I teach there for much longer as far as future job competitiveness (Main fear: What if I have to move later in my life, and can no longer find a job because all I've taught is private school?)

So anyways, I've pretty much decided that I will be looking for a new job this year.

But here is the dilemma: To tell or not to tell?

- My principal really loves me and would probably write me a GREAT recommendation letter, which would really help my applications. But...the school also has set the precedence of immediately posting jobs when they hear a teacher is leaving. Teachers on the job hunt have been replaced for the next year before they found a new job.

On the one hand, I would really be boosting my applications and would be more likely to get a job if I have the recommendation letter of my principal. On the other hand, I could potentially find myself without a job which is really scary. Making matters worse, the school district I am most interested in, pretty much only posts job openings in June, so if I don't tell, I would have had to sign a contract for next year which I would then potentially have to break. That district is extremely sought after, and having a principal recommendation could really help.

http://www.teachcalifornia.org/Steps/Elementary

I'm looking at this page for pointers, and from what it looks like, I need:

- Bachelor's Degree.

- Teaching preparation Program. I'm not sure if this is the same as a master's degree? I've been told a Master's in Education wasn't necessary to begin teaching, and that I can obtain it later down the line, or is this something else? Furthermore, I've been reading that I need volunteer hours before such programs would even consider me.
 
- Basic Skills Requirement. I assume this is the CBEST, which I've registered for.

- CSET. I'm not sure which test I'm supposed to take. If I'm planning on teaching Elementary, would multiple subjects be all I need to take?

- Developing English Language Skills. I'm not sure where to take this course. Does it matter where I take it, or do I merely need to pass it?

- U.S. Constitution course. I've been told I can just pass a test rather than take a course for this. Is this true?

- Foundational computer technology course. I'm having a hard time finding the correct course to take for this. I've been seeing Computer Science foundational courses, which I assume aren't the same thing.

- RICA. Another test I assume, but I haven't looked much into it because I'm still trying to figure out the above.

Finally, I'm also wondering if subbing has a different set of requirements, or if it's the same requirements as those listed above which I assume are to become a full fledged teacher? I'd prefer to start working as soon as possible, even if only as a sub.

Sorry for the laundry list of questions, and thank you to anyone that replies. I tried asking a counsellor at my university previously, but it wasn't very helpful, and researching this myself has only made me more unsure.

http://www.teachcalifornia.org/Steps/Elementary

I'm looking at this page for pointers, and from what it looks like, I need:

- Bachelor's Degree.

- Teaching preparation Program. I'm not sure if this is the same as a master's degree? I've been told a Master's in Education wasn't necessary to begin teaching, and that I can obtain it later down the line, or is this something else? Furthermore, I've been reading that I need volunteer hours before such programs would even consider me.
 
- Basic Skills Requirement. I assume this is the CBEST, which I've registered for.

- CSET. I'm not sure which test I'm supposed to take. If I'm planning on teaching Elementary, would multiple subjects be all I need to take?

- Developing English Language Skills. I'm not sure where to take this course. Does it matter where I take it, or do I merely need to pass it?

- U.S. Constitution course. I've been told I can just pass a test rather than take a course for this. Is this true?

- Foundational computer technology course. I'm having a hard time finding the correct course to take for this. I've been seeing Computer Science foundational courses, which I assume aren't the same thing.

- RICA. Another test I assume, but I haven't looked much into it because I'm still trying to figure out the above.

Finally, I'm also wondering if subbing has a different set of requirements, or if it's the same requirements as those listed above which I assume are to become a full fledged teacher? I'd prefer to start working as soon as possible, even if only as a sub.

Sorry for the laundry list of questions, and thank you to anyone that replies. I tried asking a counsellor at my university previously, but it wasn't very helpful, and researching this myself has only made me more unsure. I'm especially scared of registering for a test or course that isn't necessary for the above requirements.

I started teaching there last year as a first year teacher fresh out of college, and started the visual art program there, which will likely be the only type of art elective at the school. I've had lots of PD on a variety of topics and had a helpful mentor the first year. I'm well-liked by the admin team and my coworkers, and am allowed a lot of creative freedom (and receive a lot of praise) in my lesson planning and how I run my class. I'm a believer in the STEM-to-STEAM movement and the importance of arts education regardless of what you plan to do in life, so I don't mind being at a STEM school, even though it's outside of my wheelhouse. All told, there's a lot going for me on a macro level at this specific school. I feel terrible guilt over even considering leaving because of all the training, support, and freedom they've given me.

There's some things I really like about teaching and feel that I'm good at, like coming up with interesting projects and creating lectures, but the actual day-to-day classroom life is maybe not meant for me. I come home crying way more often than I would have expected. Not because a kid said something mean to me or anything like that, just because I am so *tired* and stressed. I am so anxious, frustrated, and tired by my job that I feel like if I was in practically any other profession, I would have quit by now instead of considering resigning in 5-6 months. Just the sheer quantity of interaction, disciplinary or otherwise, I have to have with students on a daily basis is really draining to my introverted self. My classes are often huge (30+), and the really awesome moments I have where I feel like I'm connecting with students or see those lightbulb moments are few and far between. I have big issues with pockets of students putting in minimal effort, or not doing major projects at all. Classroom management is something I will admit I am still working on - my class is not a zoo, but it's no well-oiled machine, either.

I'm a zombie (sometimes a sad zombie) when I get home, which is having a negative effect on pretty much every other aspect of my life - my health/weight, my relationship, my own art practice, the state of my apartment, and my other hobbies. I'm also sleeping terribly over my increased anxiety over the situation. I get told that it will get better with time, but I don't know if that just means I will adjust to exhaustion, or that the quantity of interactions will become normal to me, or what. I spoke with my own high school teacher and told her how I was feeling, and she told me I wouldn't like it until year 5. Eugh.

Part of me thinks that just having students who are actually interested in art will make a big difference. I have a lot of art training and knowledge but don't really get to use a lot of it. I'm honestly afraid I'm going to lose it. One of the things I'm considering is leaving my current school in hopes of finding a position at an arts magnet school. I have asked my principal (who directly told me she wants to keep me when I hinted that I was feeling burnt out) to teach advanced or more specific arts classes, like photography, and got a ""maybe"" -- I think it is probably going to be a funding issue to hire a second art teacher, which is the only way this would be possible. 

Another thing that is gnawing at me is that I don't really create my own art on a regular basis anymore. I have a BFA in illustration and would perhaps like to pursue freelancing, but don't feel I have the time or energy to be a full-time teacher and to have a satisfying freelance career. Maybe I would once I get really really used to teaching, but maybe I wouldn't, either. I have the knowledge and skills required as well as enough money saved up to be able to have some ""cushion"" if work is lean, but I'm still a bit nervous about the prospect of actually jumping out of my teaching job and doing this since it can be a very tough field. I'm young, I don't have kids or a mortgage, and lots of other factors that I think would later on definitely prevent me from leaving a stable job like teaching for starting a riskier one. 

TL;DR: I have a good situation re: admin support at my current teaching job, but crappy, exhausting experiences in my day-to-day classroom life. I want help in sorting out whether I should leave that in favor of an arts-focused school, another art ed job outside of the classroom, or a freelance illustration career.

I want help in sorting out whether I should leave that in favor of an arts-focused school, another art ed job outside of the classroom, or a freelance illustration career.

Help me, fellow teachers, art or otherwise... I'm stressin'.",292,compound,0.9987,2016

First year teacher here going through the typical ups and downs. Teaching 8th grade ELA and have had what most would consider a pretty successful year so far but feeling very conflicted with teaching at times. The breakthrough moments are great but feel few and far between and there are certain things that make me miserable and that I'm not quite sure I will ever get used to/learn to cope with. Teachers, tell me your thoughts on these subjects and tell me if they get easier after year one!

1. Speaking while I'm speaking.
I know it's not personal but it truly makes me mad anytime I am addressing the whole class and a student starts speaking. Happens several times a week and it's just as annoying every time.

2. Students who do no work/do not care.
There are 2-3 students in each one of my classes who do basically nothing. I've tried to get to the root of why, have heart to hearts, contact home, stay after with them, get tough on them, and actually fail them and still nothing changes. 

3. Complaining.
I always overhear students complaining about their classes, their school, how they don't learn anything, how the teachers here don't teach. It makes me so mad because they're extremely privileged to attend their school, I know the teachers are all working their butts off, and just the idea of students saying that about my class kills me because of all of the crazy work I put into it.

4. Working at home.
I work on stuff at home literally every day besides Saturday. If not, I'm behind. Just the idea of this forever gives me anxiety.

5. Discipline. 
Foolishly, I thought most of my teaching would revolve around my content and positive relationships with my students. Instead, I'm noticing now much time is taken up with tasks like monitoring cell phone use, taking headphones away, having lunch detentions, etc. None of this is stuff I care to do whatsoever.

6. Comparing.
I'm constantly comparing myself to other teachers and feeling inadequate compared to them, the way their classes run, and the grades their students are able to achieve. Though I've been observed and praised a lot, I don't feel like a great teacher very often.

Thanks in advance for any and all responses!

I'm a third-year teacher that started the year in mid-October due to maternity leave. The transition back was mostly good (except for the fact that I'm more of a stickler to the rules than my long term sub, but that is not a huge nor important issue), and I have really clicked with most of my students.

Some background is probably helpful for this situation, as well. I teach 8th grade Dual Language, in which students who speak English or Spanish as their native language learn both languages simultaneously. Since I have the kids in 8th grade, their last year of the program, I have kids who are either fully embracing the program or completely rejecting it due to it being their last year. All in all, I enjoy the group because they're all very familiar with each other. However, their closeness is the problem.

I have two students in the same class that are native English speakers. One has decent Spanish skills and the other struggles tremendously. While that's not exactly the issue, every time I change the seating chart or say something they don't agree with, I get the worst attitude possible back as a response. They will complain aloud their grievances (that they want to sit together... yet I won't let that happen because they are not productive) and have a very piss-poor attitude as a result toward everything we do in class. Both will refuse to want to do work, but eventually get around to it because they do ""care"" about their grade, not so much the learning aspect. I can deal with that, but they both are building a resentment to learning and that makes me sad more than anything. 

The Friday before winter break, the kids were going on their break (block scheduling) and they were talking bad about their seats (I can't recall what they were saying exactly) and I finally said something in response. ""Listen, I can't please everyone when I make a seating chart. I don't have enough room in the class, there's way too many students, and it's impossible to sit everyone next to whom they would prefer to work with."" They stopped talking, even though I saw them look at each other and they both silently shook their heads. I then gave their biweekly reflection, which provides the kids to tell me about the class and what's going on in their life.

Holy cow. I have never felt so attacked in my life by a student. Reading those two girls' responses made me livid. I was accused of lying, told that I let everyone in the class sit next to their best friends but never them, and that they're the only ones every working in their groups (which is a lie...). I've heard kids say bad things behind my back, but this was direct to me. I don't understand the sense of entitlement or the fact that they feel they can say these things without consequence. Also, two weeks prior they wrote something similar that I yell at them (I don't) and spoke very poorly of another girl in the class (that is very quiet and probably doesn't deserve that type of ridicule).

I'm kind of at a loss at what to do or say. Ideally, I would prefer to do a schedule change and separate the girls (they're too toxic together), but that will reflect poorly on me and then I would have a class of 32 (I don't want to do that). I'm thinking about contacting parents, but I have a feeling that the parents might be enablers and probably don't think their student is doing anything wrong. 

How I do seating charts is through a website called Happy Class App. I put in the seating arrangement, students, and then indicate which students work well together and which ones don't work well together. I gather this data from what the STUDENTS tell me and just put in the information of who doesn't work well together. Funny thing is, most students say they don't work well with these two girls (gee I wonder why).

What I was accused of lying about was the seating chart. I said that the computer generates it for me, but then she heard me say to someone that it took over an hour to make and because of that reason I'm not making any changes. I did indeed work on it for about an hour (program is somewhat slow to load, and there were a lot of students...). The program arranges the seats to achieve ""optimal happiness"", even with so many constraints. Their class's seating chart was rated at 87% happiness. With 29 students, that means 25 will be happy and 4 will not be due to the arrangement.  

At this point, I'm not sure what I'm even trying to fix with these students. It seems that they are used to getting their way and they've become accustomed to speaking their mind without thought of whether or not it's appropriate or the right thing to do. My preference is that they stop focusing on their seat and focus on their learning. What should be my next course of action?

I then gave their biweekly reflection, which provides the kids to tell me about the class and what's going on in their life.

Holy cow. I have never felt so attacked in my life by a student. Reading those two girls' responses made me livid. I was accused of lying, told that I let everyone in the class sit next to their best friends but never them, and that they're the only ones every working in their groups (which is a lie...). I've heard kids say bad things behind my back, but this was direct to me. I don't understand the sense of entitlement or the fact that they feel they can say these things without consequence. Also, two weeks prior they wrote something similar that I yell at them (I don't) and spoke very poorly of another girl in the class (that is very quiet and probably doesn't deserve that type of ridicule).

I'm kind of at a loss at what to do or say. Ideally, I would prefer to do a schedule change and separate the girls (they're too toxic together), but that will reflect poorly on me and then I would have a class of 32 (I don't want to do that). I'm thinking about contacting parents, but I have a feeling that the parents might be enablers and probably don't think their student is doing anything wrong. 

How I do seating charts is through a website called Happy Class App. I put in the seating arrangement, students, and then indicate which students work well together and which ones don't work well together. I gather this data from what the STUDENTS tell me and just put in the information of who doesn't work well together. Funny thing is, most students say they don't work well with these two girls (gee I wonder why).

What I was accused of lying about was the seating chart. I said that the computer generates it for me, but then she heard me say to someone that it took over an hour to make and because of that reason I'm not making any changes. I did indeed work on it for about an hour (program is somewhat slow to load, and there were a lot of students...). The program arranges the seats to achieve ""optimal happiness"", even with so many constraints. Their class's seating chart was rated at 87% happiness. With 29 students, that means 25 will be happy and 4 will not be due to the arrangement.  

At this point, I'm not sure what I'm even trying to fix with these students. It seems that they are used to getting their way and they've become accustomed to speaking their mind without thought of whether or not it's appropriate or the right thing to do. My preference is that they stop focusing on their seat and focus on their learning. What should be my next course of action? School starts Monday.",299,compound,-0.966,2016

I'm visiting with my co-workers too much during my off period or lunch. I'm not going to extra-curricular activities to see my students. I'm not teaching them enough. I'm not -engaging- enough. 

As I was discussing this with a fellow teacher, I realized the very root of my discontent is that I don't feel like I'm engaging them enough. My lessons aren't always ""fun."" I don't always have sparkle, piazza, videos, audio, ""cool"" real world examples. I feel like I'm failing my students because my class isn't always fun. I find this to be very concerning. 

Contrary to what the education ""gods"" want us to believe, learning isn't always fun. It can be tedious, it can be challenging, it can be disheartening, but still, one can learn from these feelings. 

For example, we want students to have the ability to read and comprehend at much higher levels than where they currently reside. Yet, every lesson is supposed to incorporate audio versions of the text. When students take the all-knowing standardized tests, there won't be an audio version. What happens then? I'll tell you what happens, they do poorly on the test then feel discouraged and disgusted with education. I see it happen constantly. 

Just this week, I gave my students an ACT practice test. Everyone of my 80 juniors failed it. Every. Last. One. The curriculum we are mandated to use has us put on a dog and pony show when students are ""reading"" a text. Either I'm reading it for them, they're listening to an audio, or they're reading it in a group. They are rarely asked to read anything independently. And they have been conditioned to have everything given to them, so when they are asked to do that, they can't. If I read the text and then ask them the same questions they were asked when they read independently? They can answer it, no problem. 

There's a problem here. This ""engaging"" lesson has gone too far. I feel pressure constantly to do better, be better, do more...yet I'm giving EVERYTHING I have to this job. There's a serious discontent among students and teachers and it's heartbreaking. I often tell myself I'm going to find another career, yet I can't think of anything else I want to do. I love teaching, but I hate being a teacher.

She said that her student no longer liked school, and thought I was mean/moody, and was afraid of me. I was so hurt by this, and surprised. At school the student is all smiles, and seems to have a great time. I'm 5ft tall, never yell, always smiling (the kids say this) and I am always considerate of the students feelings when redirecting their behavior. I never call them out, instead I pull them aside, and discuss it with them. 

She wanted to know what I did to encourage ""following the rules,"" said I didn't have enough reward parties, and didn't give enough preferred activity time (time they earn). She also doesn't understand why I give consequences at all, and would like it to stop right away.She also feels that I need to send home daily/weekly emails of all the things we do because he told her I only tell them about tests a day in advance. She would like me to send home an email each week to tell her what is happening, or written instructions for her student when he supposed to tell her something. 

My class is on Schoology, and all the due dates are visible a month in advance. Before that we had planners that the students were expected to show parents. I sent paper copies home for him when his mom asked. 

Basically the whole email revealed to me that her student outright lies to her daily about my class. I understand that she believes him over me, but I just don't know how to fix what isn't broken. My principal was supportive, but this mom is on the war path. 

I believe that her student is unhappy, but it is because he is trying to live up to his super smart brother, and he can't keep up. He has to be the best academically, and failure is unacceptable to his dad. I want to make sure he is ok in class, but I can't fix what I don't see and he won't share his concerns with me. 

I have endless positive reinforcement methods in place (at least 6), and consequences are rare. We have 20-25 minutes PAT minutes each week that the students earn. We have fun, but we work hard.

It's Title I and in a large urban school district. I started teaching there last year as a first year teacher fresh out of college, and started the visual art program there, which will likely be the only type of art elective at the school. I've had lots of PD on a variety of topics and had a helpful mentor the first year. I'm well-liked by the admin team and my coworkers, and am allowed a lot of creative freedom (and receive a lot of praise) in my lesson planning and how I run my class. I'm a believer in the STEM-to-STEAM movement and the importance of arts education regardless of what you plan to do in life, so I don't mind being at a STEM school, even though it's outside of my wheelhouse. All told, there's a lot going for me on a macro level at this specific school. I feel terrible guilt over even considering leaving because of all the training, support, and freedom they've given me.

There's some things I really like about teaching and feel that I'm good at, like coming up with interesting projects and creating lectures, but the actual day-to-day classroom life is maybe not meant for me. I come home crying way more often than I would have expected. Not because a kid said something mean to me or anything like that, just because I am so *tired* and stressed. I am so anxious, frustrated, and tired by my job that I feel like if I was in practically any other profession, I would have quit by now instead of considering resigning in 5-6 months. Just the sheer quantity of interaction, disciplinary or otherwise, I have to have with students on a daily basis is really draining to my introverted self. My classes are often huge (30+), and the really awesome moments I have where I feel like I'm connecting with students or see those lightbulb moments are few and far between. I have big issues with pockets of students putting in minimal effort, or not doing major projects at all. Classroom management is something I will admit I am still working on - my class is not a zoo, but it's no well-oiled machine, either.

I'm a zombie (sometimes a sad zombie) when I get home, which is having a negative effect on pretty much every other aspect of my life - my health/weight, my relationship, my own art practice, the state of my apartment, and my other hobbies. I'm also sleeping terribly over my increased anxiety over the situation. I get told that it will get better with time, but I don't know if that just means I will adjust to exhaustion, or that the quantity of interactions will become normal to me, or what. I spoke with my own high school teacher and told her how I was feeling, and she told me I wouldn't like it until year 5. Eugh.

Part of me thinks that just having students who are actually interested in art will make a big difference. I have a lot of art training and knowledge but don't really get to use a lot of it. I'm honestly afraid I'm going to lose it. One of the things I'm considering is leaving my current school in hopes of finding a position at an arts magnet school. I have asked my principal (who directly told me she wants to keep me when I hinted that I was feeling burnt out) to teach advanced or more specific arts classes, like photography, and got a ""maybe"" -- I think it is probably going to be a funding issue to hire a second art teacher, which is the only way this would be possible. 

Another thing that is gnawing at me is that I don't really create my own art on a regular basis anymore. I have a BFA in illustration and would perhaps like to pursue freelancing, but don't feel I have the time or energy to be a full-time teacher and to have a satisfying freelance career. Maybe I would once I get really really used to teaching, but maybe I wouldn't, either. I have the knowledge and skills required as well as enough money saved up to be able to have some ""cushion"" if work is lean, but I'm still a bit nervous about the prospect of actually jumping out of my teaching job and doing this since it can be a very tough field. I'm young, I don't have kids or a mortgage, and lots of other factors that I think would later on definitely prevent me from leaving a stable job like teaching for starting a riskier one. 

TL;DR: I have a good situation re: admin support at my current teaching job, but crappy, exhausting experiences in my day-to-day classroom life. I want help in sorting out whether I should leave that in favor of an arts-focused school, another art ed job outside of the classroom, or a freelance illustration career.

I'm a third-year teacher that started the year in mid-October due to maternity leave. The transition back was mostly good (except for the fact that I'm more of a stickler to the rules than my long term sub, but that is not a huge nor important issue), and I have really clicked with most of my students.

Some background is probably helpful for this situation, as well. I teach 8th grade Dual Language, in which students who speak English or Spanish as their native language learn both languages simultaneously. Since I have the kids in 8th grade, their last year of the program, I have kids who are either fully embracing the program or completely rejecting it due to it being their last year. All in all, I enjoy the group because they're all very familiar with each other. However, their closeness is the problem.

I have two students in the same class that are native English speakers. One has decent Spanish skills and the other struggles tremendously. While that's not exactly the issue, every time I change the seating chart or say something they don't agree with, I get the worst attitude possible back as a response. They will complain aloud their grievances (that they want to sit together... yet I won't let that happen because they are not productive) and have a very piss-poor attitude as a result toward everything we do in class. Both will refuse to want to do work, but eventually get around to it because they do ""care"" about their grade, not so much the learning aspect. I can deal with that, but they both are building a resentment to learning and that makes me sad more than anything. 

The Friday before winter break, the kids were going on their break (block scheduling) and they were talking bad about their seats (I can't recall what they were saying exactly) and I finally said something in response. ""Listen, I can't please everyone when I make a seating chart. I don't have enough room in the class, there's way too many students, and it's impossible to sit everyone next to whom they would prefer to work with."" They stopped talking, even though I saw them look at each other and they both silently shook their heads. I then gave their biweekly reflection, which provides the kids to tell me about the class and what's going on in their life.

Holy cow. I have never felt so attacked in my life by a student. Reading those two girls' responses made me livid. I was accused of lying, told that I let everyone in the class sit next to their best friends but never them, and that they're the only ones every working in their groups (which is a lie...). I've heard kids say bad things behind my back, but this was direct to me. I don't understand the sense of entitlement or the fact that they feel they can say these things without consequence. Also, two weeks prior they wrote something similar that I yell at them (I don't) and spoke very poorly of another girl in the class (that is very quiet and probably doesn't deserve that type of ridicule).

I'm kind of at a loss at what to do or say. Ideally, I would prefer to do a schedule change and separate the girls (they're too toxic together), but that will reflect poorly on me and then I would have a class of 32 (I don't want to do that). I'm thinking about contacting parents, but I have a feeling that the parents might be enablers and probably don't think their student is doing anything wrong. 

How I do seating charts is through a website called Happy Class App. I put in the seating arrangement, students, and then indicate which students work well together and which ones don't work well together. I gather this data from what the STUDENTS tell me and just put in the information of who doesn't work well together. Funny thing is, most students say they don't work well with these two girls (gee I wonder why).

What I was accused of lying about was the seating chart. I said that the computer generates it for me, but then she heard me say to someone that it took over an hour to make and because of that reason I'm not making any changes. I did indeed work on it for about an hour (program is somewhat slow to load, and there were a lot of students...). The program arranges the seats to achieve ""optimal happiness"", even with so many constraints. Their class's seating chart was rated at 87% happiness. With 29 students, that means 25 will be happy and 4 will not be due to the arrangement.  

At this point, I'm not sure what I'm even trying to fix with these students. It seems that they are used to getting their way and they've become accustomed to speaking their mind without thought of whether or not it's appropriate or the right thing to do. My preference is that they stop focusing on their seat and focus on their learning. What should be my next course of action?

I'm a junior in high school who was home-schooled until the eighth grade. I'm third in my class (of maybe 115?), in all honors classes with straight As, and a varsity athlete. I go to a kind of small school in a relatively rural but not overly hillbilly-ish area, and we consistently score well on standardized tests/evaluations/et cetera. What I'm getting at is that we're not some crappy school with gang issues and violence and cops prowling around or something. I'm also in NHS and Boy Scouts. I say all of this not because I have a weird complex that makes me want to brag to teachers I've never met on some random subreddit, but to establish why I'm annoyed at what I'm about to talk about here.

All but maybe 4 of the roughly 30 teachers I've had so far have been incredibly suspicious of their students, me included, for probably the first four to eight weeks of class, and some remain that way for most of the year. I understand that it's easy to become jaded after dealing with just one or two morons per year over a decades-long teaching career, but I still find it pretty hard to come up with a justification for even the nicest teachers I've had doing things like giving people detentions for pulling their phones out 10 seconds (not an expression, I'm literally talking about less than the duration of 91,926,317,700 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom) before the bell rings, or yelling at a guy to ""stop playing on his phone below his desk"" when it's clearly and obviously sitting face down on the corner of said desk. It feels like a few of them sincerely want to find something to be angry about more than they want to teach, which, despite the fact that I know  it not to be the case, is a pretty upsetting sentiment to get from a teacher. We (and by ""we"" I mean my classmates, my parents, and my awesome German teacher) laugh under our breaths at and casually dismiss the disturbing irony of our calculus teacher spending twenty minutes (VERY slight hyperbole) ranting about all the ways STUDENTS like to waste class time, but the fact remains that it's really no way for a teacher (or anybody else, for that matter) to be acting, and it is unfortunately not all that uncommon at our school.

I don't want this to be construed as some kind of personal vendetta against teachers or the ramblings of a kid who's burned up about getting in trouble over a phone (for the record, I have yet to get in any kind of trouble at school), and I don't even have words for the amount of respect I have for teachers as a whole, because I know it can be a low-paying, aggravating, sometimes unappreciated job, but I've seen stuff like this in everybody from a first-year Health teacher to a goofball Government teacher who couldn't be bothered to use spellcheck on anything he typed to a Biology/Chemistry teacher a year from retirement who wasn't even required to take the school technology orientation because he was so close to being done. Given the borderline universal nature of the types of attitudes I'm talking about here, I get the feeling that they are not unique to any particular kind of person, or by any means to my school alone.

I guess my question ultimately boils down to this: Why are so many teachers inherently mistrustful, even at a great school with great students, and what can I do to gain their trust a little earlier in the year than midterms? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

TLDR:
Teachers at my school are, in a word, cynical, regardless of their age, experience, subject, or the types of kids they teach. (I still have a ton of respect for teachers as a whole; this is not meant as an attack.) Advice?

Edit: Thanks to everybody for sharing your thoughts on this. I'm sure you all know from dealing with colleagues that it can be hard to ask questions like this in person because you can't write out your entire thought and then submit it like you can on here, so it's nice to have a conversation like this every once in a while.

I understand that it's easy to become jaded after dealing with just one or two morons per year over a decades-long teaching career, but I still find it pretty hard to come up with a justification for even the nicest teachers I've had doing things like giving people detentions for pulling their phones out 10 seconds (not an expression, I'm literally talking about less than the duration of 91,926,317,700 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom) before the bell rings, or yelling at a guy to ""stop playing on his phone below his desk"" when it's clearly and obviously sitting face down on the corner of said desk. It feels like a few of them sincerely want to find something to be angry about more than they want to teach, which, despite the fact that I know  it not to be the case, is a pretty upsetting sentiment to get from a teacher. We (and by ""we"" I mean my classmates, my parents, and my awesome German teacher) laugh under our breaths at and casually dismiss the disturbing irony of our calculus teacher spending twenty minutes (VERY slight hyperbole) ranting about all the ways STUDENTS like to waste class time, but the fact remains that it's really no way for a teacher (or anybody else, for that matter) to be acting, and it is unfortunately not all that uncommon at our school.

I don't want this to be construed as some kind of personal vendetta against teachers or the ramblings of a kid who's burned up about getting in trouble over a phone (for the record, I have yet to get in any kind of trouble at school), and I don't even have words for the amount of respect I have for teachers as a whole, because I know it can be a low-paying, aggravating, sometimes unappreciated job, but I've seen stuff like this in everybody from a first-year Health teacher to a goofball Government teacher who couldn't be bothered to use spellcheck on anything he typed to a Biology/Chemistry teacher a year from retirement who wasn't even required to take the school technology orientation because he was so close to being done. Given the borderline universal nature of the types of attitudes I'm talking about here, I get the feeling that they are not unique to any particular kind of person, or by any means to my school alone.

I guess my question ultimately boils down to this: Why are so many teachers inherently mistrustful, even at a great school with great students, and what can I do to gain their trust a little earlier in the year than midterms? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

TLDR:
Teachers at my school are, in a word, cynical, regardless of their age, experience, subject, or the types of kids they teach. (I still have a ton of respect for teachers as a whole; this is not meant as an attack.) Advice?

Edit: Thanks to everybody for sharing your thoughts on this. I'm sure you all know from dealing with colleagues that it can be hard to ask questions like this in person because you can't write out your entire thought and then submit it like you can on here, so it's nice to have a conversation like this every once in a while.

This is my first year teaching sixth grade science though I spent some time at the high school level with Earth and Physical Science. Before break we finished animal cells, and now that we are coming back from break we are doing plant cells. 

I love science but I absolutely abhor the ""Build A Cell/Edible Cell"" project. I just view it as a mess and hassle rather than a learning experience. As well, most of my students do not have the means to get materials for such a project. I teach a 40 minute class period so doing such a project IN class is tough because by the time we come in and get going... it is time to pack up again.

This is my first year teaching sixth grade science though I spent some time at the high school level with Earth and Physical Science. Before break we finished animal cells, and now that we are coming back from break we are doing plant cells. 

I love science but I absolutely abhor the ""Build A Cell/Edible Cell"" project. I just view it as a mess and hassle rather than a learning experience. As well, most of my students do not have the means to get materials for such a project. I teach a 40 minute class period so doing such a project IN class is tough because by the time we come in and get going... it is time to pack up again.

Students ask about religious preferences, political opinions, personal lives, etc.  Some teachers indulge them.  Others design curricula that clearly favor particular viewpoint or philosophies.  Holding off the students is not really a challenge -- I have canned responses like ""That is not your business,"" ""Expressing my own opinions is a violation of our relationship,"" etc.

The list goes on.  Faculty/staff have quit because they feel their ""life experiences"" are not valued, whatever the hell that means.

I think all of this is mind-bogglingly stupid, but that is beside the point.  The real issue is that I have managed to hold my ground thus far, but it is becoming more difficulty because the share-to-relate and sharing-is-always-and-inherently-good mindsets are increasingly dominating the campus, to the extent that analytical writing at times seems like a side dish to the personal essay.

The theory is, students in SPED are in environment to adjust to general ed. Problem is, my world history class has 15 SPED students and 5 Long Term English Learns and ONLY 4 gen ed. Total antithesis to the theory. Admin would only add more students for help. This is not about that issue per-say.


This issue is about and African American student and my running out of ideas as to what to do.

Class:

Six African American, several Latinos, several Asian and mix of others, one autistic. Multiple ELL.

Started out with class vote for Greek myth... no dice. Switched it up to African Colonization.... Here is where I found out the Student in question is at a 5th grade reading level and was recently dis-enrolled in SPED for unknown reasons, but is still in this class... Don't ask me why. I think it's because no one wants him. 
  
Student:
All sorts of behaviors are coming from this student. Called one Muslim student in class a terrorist, another Chinese a stupid communist, doesn't get along with two African American students, but gets along with the other 3 and they follow him because he is the Alpha of the whole Sophmore class. 

Bursts out all the time. I recently went to other teachers to find out their methods. Find out they all hate him, kick him out of class all the time, has transferred multiple classes because teachers can't handle him. Dean basically said the same thing.

Me:
I have asked him to be a leader of the class. I have asked him to be more mature. Works for a little and then goes back to his behavior by end of the week.

Final straw:

I did a seating chart specifically because  of him and he looked around the class and said I divided up all the black students he gets along with because of ""racism"" and I am a racist. 

I talked to him about it and put it back on him and said I divided everyone up because he doesn't work well with anyone in the class and he distracts the other 3 AA students he gets along with.  ""He said he got it"" Still very frustrating to be called a racist because of a seating chart. 


New semester, same shit. I plan on calling his mother after I talk to him again. I have heard to be very careful with her because school has had multiple issues with her. 

My guess is I believe it's his inability to read and he doesn't want to look stupid in front of his peers so he will do ANYTHING to avoid looking stupid. 

It's crazy though. I went to all the other teachers and they all gave long stories about him and detest him. 

I can handle him, but he is a real distraction to the class and it is just getting really frustrating that no one can reach him....

I'm pursuing a degree in Middle School Ed, and I'll be starting what we call ""Methods Teaching"" this semester. I believe I will co-teach for at least two weeks, if not more.

I'm pursuing a degree in Middle School Ed, and I'll be starting what we call ""Methods Teaching"" this semester. I believe I will co-teach for at least two weeks, if not more.

I'm a paraeducator working with middle schoolers as a mentor (goal is to become a school counselor).  I try to be very intentional with my words to avoid implying things I don't mean to say and to convey my meaning in the best possible way, which is why I'm asking this question that might sound trivial to you.  

**What is the best way to introduce students to new or unfamiliar words when having an informal conversation with them?** (i.e. not in a classroom setting, but in a one-on-one or small group setting.)  I want to make sure my messages are getting through to kids, but sometimes I end up using more advanced words than they are used to.  I also want to avoid making students feel like I think they're stupid or that they aren't meeting my expectations.

For example, today I was talking to a kid about conflict and I used the word ""retaliate""^*, when I realized I didn't know whether my students were likely to be familiar with that word (I do not have formal training in education yet).

I ended up asking, ""Do you know what that word means?""  but later realized that sometimes kids feel obligated to say ""yes"" because the phrasing of the question makes them think they *should* know what it means, even if they actually don't.

I was thinking of more possible questions to use, like ""Have you heard that word before?""  But I don't want them to think that I think they're stupid if it's a word they use all the time.

I am almost definitely overthinking this, as I tend to do that... but I'd still love to hear your thoughts and insight.  Does anyone have any go-to phrases they use to introduce new words without making unnecessary implications?

Soooo I finished week 3 of my full-time teaching job. I say week 3 because I started mid-year - 0/10 would not recommend.

Everyone's encouraged me to be tough, which is not in my wheelhouse, but I am trying to get better at it ASAP. I am a short white lady who is 26 but looks 14. One of my classes is the bane of my existence (another isn't far behind...two others are OK and the other switches next semester). They NEVER ever stop talking. I've been encouraged to send them to the dean if they're misbehaving, which I have (deans are very supportive and OK with this!). Still, I feel like a deer in headlights...I don't even know whom to send first.

I can only write one dean pass at a time, so that leads to their complaining that OTHER people were doing worse stuff or that they weren't talking. I try not to engage, but sometimes I slip up and I do. This is because people always tell me (and I've seen this be true) that HS students HATE anything less than fair.

I spent the ENTIRE DAY trying to grade and plan with every spare minute I could snatch up. However, it seems that the tidal wave of nonsense and interruptions during my one lonely prep is pretty much non-stop. On top of the fact that I am also getting ""emergency"" coverages on a weekly basis. 

The major culprit is students coming to find me (without regard to whether its my lunch, my prep, or me TEACHING another class), usually to ask for help with some work, or just to hang around in my room. They also come in groups and are nearly impossible to herd out. If I lock them out, they bang on the door window, which annoys me to no end. And if I run to hide in the department office, I inevitably get sucked into conversation with whatever teachers happen to be there. When I return, kids are camped out in front of my door, waiting to descend yet again. 

On top of this, I am constantly being ask/tasked to do things for the department, often without much notice. These things get sprung on me with little notice, and often result in me attempting to get them done right away, which takes time away from what I planned to do.

I am massively behind in grading, with a final essay exam looming next week. I came home and got into an argument with my BF, as he wanted to chat (like normal people with normal jobs usually do), and I hit the laptop the second I got home, desperately scrambling to finish work that I barely made a dent in today, and got crabby with him because he was distracting me.

I'm really at a loss as to what to do. I hate bringing work home, but I feel I have no choice. I almost always stay late after school, but I am usually too wiped out to get a whole lot done, and other teachers will sometimes wander into my room, and distract me.

I spent the ENTIRE DAY trying to grade and plan with every spare minute I could snatch up. However, it seems that the tidal wave of nonsense and interruptions during my one lonely prep is pretty much non-stop. On top of the fact that I am also getting ""emergency"" coverages on a weekly basis. 

The major culprit is students coming to find me (without regard to whether its my lunch, my prep, or me TEACHING another class), usually to ask for help with some work, or just to hang around in my room. They also come in groups and are nearly impossible to herd out. If I lock them out, they bang on the door window, which annoys me to no end. And if I run to hide in the department office, I inevitably get sucked into conversation with whatever teachers happen to be there. When I return, kids are camped out in front of my door, waiting to descend yet again. 

On top of this, I am constantly being ask/tasked to do things for the department, often without much notice. These things get sprung on me with little notice, and often result in me attempting to get them done right away, which takes time away from what I planned to do.

I am massively behind in grading, with a final essay exam looming next week. I came home and got into an argument with my BF, as he wanted to chat (like normal people with normal jobs usually do), and I hit the laptop the second I got home, desperately scrambling to finish work that I barely made a dent in today, and got crabby with him because he was distracting me.

I'm really at a loss as to what to do. I hate bringing work home, but I feel I have no choice.

My probation year will begin in August and so in the meantime I am looking to pick up supply work. So far I have three possible options. 

A) One very vague job offer from a placement school who asked me to ""come in on the first day of term and we'll see where we need you"". I know this school and although it's not my ideal (multiple stages, open plan) it does have great resources and I get on well with the other staff. However, I had to move home to complete my final placement so this school is currently 2.5 hours away. I haven't sorted somewhere closer to live as I have no idea if they are offering me 5 days a week or 1 afternoon. 

B) An interview for the supply list in my local council next week. They are desperate for supply teachers (a maternity cover at my nearest school went unfilled for two months). I know this area well but it wouldn't be my first choice for long term. 

C) An interview for another council close by, also next week. They don't often advertise positions and they are not as desperate for cover. However, if I could get in I would consider working here long term. 


I'm looking for advice on: 

1. How to handle the job offer/interview situation. Do I tell the school tomorrow that I have interviews next week? Do I wait to see what they have to offer and then tell them? Do I explain that I haven't sorted somewhere to live or just deal with that on my own?

2. When I go to school A tomorrow, what should I take? I have no idea of what class I'd be in, or even if I'll be given charge of a whole class.

Part of me thinks that just having students who are actually interested in art will make a big difference. I have a lot of art training and knowledge but don't really get to use a lot of it. I'm honestly afraid I'm going to lose it. One of the things I'm considering is leaving my current school in hopes of finding a position at an arts magnet school.

I'm a third-year teacher that started the year in mid-October due to maternity leave. The transition back was mostly good (except for the fact that I'm more of a stickler to the rules than my long term sub, but that is not a huge nor important issue), and I have really clicked with most of my students.

Some background is probably helpful for this situation, as well. I teach 8th grade Dual Language, in which students who speak English or Spanish as their native language learn both languages simultaneously. Since I have the kids in 8th grade, their last year of the program, I have kids who are either fully embracing the program or completely rejecting it due to it being their last year. All in all, I enjoy the group because they're all very familiar with each other. However, their closeness is the problem.

I have two students in the same class that are native English speakers. One has decent Spanish skills and the other struggles tremendously. While that's not exactly the issue, every time I change the seating chart or say something they don't agree with, I get the worst attitude possible back as a response. They will complain aloud their grievances (that they want to sit together... yet I won't let that happen because they are not productive) and have a very piss-poor attitude as a result toward everything we do in class. Both will refuse to want to do work, but eventually get around to it because they do ""care"" about their grade, not so much the learning aspect. I can deal with that, but they both are building a resentment to learning and that makes me sad more than anything. 

The Friday before winter break, the kids were going on their break (block scheduling) and they were talking bad about their seats (I can't recall what they were saying exactly) and I finally said something in response. ""Listen, I can't please everyone when I make a seating chart. I don't have enough room in the class, there's way too many students, and it's impossible to sit everyone next to whom they would prefer to work with."" They stopped talking, even though I saw them look at each other and they both silently shook their heads. I then gave their biweekly reflection, which provides the kids to tell me about the class and what's going on in their life.

Holy cow. I have never felt so attacked in my life by a student. Reading those two girls' responses made me livid. I was accused of lying, told that I let everyone in the class sit next to their best friends but never them, and that they're the only ones every working in their groups (which is a lie...). I've heard kids say bad things behind my back, but this was direct to me. I don't understand the sense of entitlement or the fact that they feel they can say these things without consequence. Also, two weeks prior they wrote something similar that I yell at them (I don't) and spoke very poorly of another girl in the class (that is very quiet and probably doesn't deserve that type of ridicule).

I'm kind of at a loss at what to do or say. Ideally, I would prefer to do a schedule change and separate the girls (they're too toxic together), but that will reflect poorly on me and then I would have a class of 32 (I don't want to do that). I'm thinking about contacting parents, but I have a feeling that the parents might be enablers and probably don't think their student is doing anything wrong. 

How I do seating charts is through a website called Happy Class App. I put in the seating arrangement, students, and then indicate which students work well together and which ones don't work well together. I gather this data from what the STUDENTS tell me and just put in the information of who doesn't work well together. Funny thing is, most students say they don't work well with these two girls (gee I wonder why).

What I was accused of lying about was the seating chart. I said that the computer generates it for me, but then she heard me say to someone that it took over an hour to make and because of that reason I'm not making any changes. I did indeed work on it for about an hour (program is somewhat slow to load, and there were a lot of students...). The program arranges the seats to achieve ""optimal happiness"", even with so many constraints. Their class's seating chart was rated at 87% happiness. With 29 students, that means 25 will be happy and 4 will not be due to the arrangement.  

At this point, I'm not sure what I'm even trying to fix with these students. It seems that they are used to getting their way and they've become accustomed to speaking their mind without thought of whether or not it's appropriate or the right thing to do. My preference is that they stop focusing on their seat and focus on their learning. What should be my next course of action?

Ideally, I would prefer to do a schedule change and separate the girls (they're too toxic together), but that will reflect poorly on me and then I would have a class of 32 (I don't want to do that). I'm thinking about contacting parents, but I have a feeling that the parents might be enablers and probably don't think their student is doing anything wrong. 

How I do seating charts is through a website called Happy Class App. I put in the seating arrangement, students, and then indicate which students work well together and which ones don't work well together. I gather this data from what the STUDENTS tell me and just put in the information of who doesn't work well together. Funny thing is, most students say they don't work well with these two girls (gee I wonder why).

What I was accused of lying about was the seating chart. I said that the computer generates it for me, but then she heard me say to someone that it took over an hour to make and because of that reason I'm not making any changes. I did indeed work on it for about an hour (program is somewhat slow to load, and there were a lot of students...). The program arranges the seats to achieve ""optimal happiness"", even with so many constraints. Their class's seating chart was rated at 87% happiness. With 29 students, that means 25 will be happy and 4 will not be due to the arrangement.  

At this point, I'm not sure what I'm even trying to fix with these students. It seems that they are used to getting their way and they've become accustomed to speaking their mind without thought of whether or not it's appropriate or the right thing to do. My preference is that they stop focusing on their seat and focus on their learning. What should be my next course of action? School starts Monday.",417,compound,-0.966,2016

What I'm getting at is that we're not some crappy school with gang issues and violence and cops prowling around or something. I'm also in NHS and Boy Scouts. I say all of this not because I have a weird complex that makes me want to brag to teachers I've never met on some random subreddit, but to establish why I'm annoyed at what I'm about to talk about here.

All but maybe 4 of the roughly 30 teachers I've had so far have been incredibly suspicious of their students, me included, for probably the first four to eight weeks of class, and some remain that way for most of the year. I understand that it's easy to become jaded after dealing with just one or two morons per year over a decades-long teaching career, but I still find it pretty hard to come up with a justification for even the nicest teachers I've had doing things like giving people detentions for pulling their phones out 10 seconds (not an expression, I'm literally talking about less than the duration of 91,926,317,700 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom) before the bell rings, or yelling at a guy to ""stop playing on his phone below his desk"" when it's clearly and obviously sitting face down on the corner of said desk. It feels like a few of them sincerely want to find something to be angry about more than they want to teach, which, despite the fact that I know  it not to be the case, is a pretty upsetting sentiment to get from a teacher. We (and by ""we"" I mean my classmates, my parents, and my awesome German teacher) laugh under our breaths at and casually dismiss the disturbing irony of our calculus teacher spending twenty minutes (VERY slight hyperbole) ranting about all the ways STUDENTS like to waste class time, but the fact remains that it's really no way for a teacher (or anybody else, for that matter) to be acting, and it is unfortunately not all that uncommon at our school.

I don't want this to be construed as some kind of personal vendetta against teachers or the ramblings of a kid who's burned up about getting in trouble over a phone (for the record, I have yet to get in any kind of trouble at school), and I don't even have words for the amount of respect I have for teachers as a whole, because I know it can be a low-paying, aggravating, sometimes unappreciated job, but I've seen stuff like this in everybody from a first-year Health teacher to a goofball Government teacher who couldn't be bothered to use spellcheck on anything he typed to a Biology/Chemistry teacher a year from retirement who wasn't even required to take the school technology orientation because he was so close to being done. Given the borderline universal nature of the types of attitudes I'm talking about here, I get the feeling that they are not unique to any particular kind of person, or by any means to my school alone.

I guess my question ultimately boils down to this: Why are so many teachers inherently mistrustful, even at a great school with great students, and what can I do to gain their trust a little earlier in the year than midterms? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

TLDR:
Teachers at my school are, in a word, cynical, regardless of their age, experience, subject, or the types of kids they teach. (I still have a ton of respect for teachers as a whole; this is not meant as an attack.) Advice?

Edit: Thanks to everybody for sharing your thoughts on this.

I guess my question ultimately boils down to this: Why are so many teachers inherently mistrustful, even at a great school with great students, and what can I do to gain their trust a little earlier in the year than midterms? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

TLDR:
Teachers at my school are, in a word, cynical, regardless of their age, experience, subject, or the types of kids they teach. (I still have a ton of respect for teachers as a whole; this is not meant as an attack.) Advice?

Edit: Thanks to everybody for sharing your thoughts on this. I'm sure you all know from dealing with colleagues that it can be hard to ask questions like this in person because you can't write out your entire thought and then submit it like you can on here, so it's nice to have a conversation like this every once in a while.

The school is quite small, and class size ranges from about 8-16.  The kids are extremely intelligent and from diverse backgrounds, but unfortunately undereducated and have little training in etiquette or logic, both of which I lament (to myself). 

Students ask about religious preferences, political opinions, personal lives, etc.  Some teachers indulge them.  Others design curricula that clearly favor particular viewpoint or philosophies.  Holding off the students is not really a challenge -- I have canned responses like ""That is not your business,"" ""Expressing my own opinions is a violation of our relationship,"" etc.

The problem is that the faculty and staff also apparently have no personal boundaries either.  I am subjected to long and inane stories about my colleagues' diseased pets, updates about their love and sex lives, food they ate at different restaurants, horrifying stories of family drama that sometimes spans generations, etc.  This I find much harder to deal with because telling other adults they are being unprofessional is less palatable than telling students they are overstepping.  I have done it, but I would rather not.

For the record, I have no problem sharing personal details with colleagues who are actual, meaningful friends outside of the school day.  I do have an issue with being subjected to political opinions and being asked my own.  I have actually responded ""No comment"" when asked about the rise of racial activist movements on campuses (my alma mater was one of the most reported ones).  I was told that that was a ""boring response,"" so I guess it worked.

The real issue is that the administration encourages sharing our personal lives with each other and our students, being ""vulnerable"" -- including listening for an hour to administrations describing their insecurities and failures -- having ""compassionate conversations"" wherein students and even teachers are expected to share their personal ""experiences"" and whatnot with each other.  The list goes on.  Faculty/staff have quit because they feel their ""life experiences"" are not valued, whatever the hell that means.

I think all of this is mind-bogglingly stupid, but that is beside the point.  The real issue is that I have managed to hold my ground thus far, but it is becoming more difficulty because the share-to-relate and sharing-is-always-and-inherently-good mindsets are increasingly dominating the campus, to the extent that analytical writing at times seems like a side dish to the personal essay.

The school is quite small, and class size ranges from about 8-16.  The kids are extremely intelligent and from diverse backgrounds, but unfortunately undereducated and have little training in etiquette or logic, both of which I lament (to myself). 

Students ask about religious preferences, political opinions, personal lives, etc.  Some teachers indulge them.  Others design curricula that clearly favor particular viewpoint or philosophies.  Holding off the students is not really a challenge -- I have canned responses like ""That is not your business,"" ""Expressing my own opinions is a violation of our relationship,"" etc.

The problem is that the faculty and staff also apparently have no personal boundaries either.  I am subjected to long and inane stories about my colleagues' diseased pets, updates about their love and sex lives, food they ate at different restaurants, horrifying stories of family drama that sometimes spans generations, etc.  This I find much harder to deal with because telling other adults they are being unprofessional is less palatable than telling students they are overstepping.  I have done it, but I would rather not.

For the record, I have no problem sharing personal details with colleagues who are actual, meaningful friends outside of the school day.  I do have an issue with being subjected to political opinions and being asked my own.  I have actually responded ""No comment"" when asked about the rise of racial activist movements on campuses (my alma mater was one of the most reported ones).  I was told that that was a ""boring response,"" so I guess it worked.

The real issue is that the administration encourages sharing our personal lives with each other and our students, being ""vulnerable"" -- including listening for an hour to administrations describing their insecurities and failures -- having ""compassionate conversations"" wherein students and even teachers are expected to share their personal ""experiences"" and whatnot with each other.  The list goes on.  Faculty/staff have quit because they feel their ""life experiences"" are not valued, whatever the hell that means.

I think all of this is mind-bogglingly stupid, but that is beside the point.  The real issue is that I have managed to hold my ground thus far, but it is becoming more difficulty because the share-to-relate and sharing-is-always-and-inherently-good mindsets are increasingly dominating the campus, to the extent that analytical writing at times seems like a side dish to the personal essay.

Six African American, several Latinos, several Asian and mix of others, one autistic. Multiple ELL.

Started out with class vote for Greek myth... no dice. Switched it up to African Colonization....

Student:
All sorts of behaviors are coming from this student. Called one Muslim student in class a terrorist, another Chinese a stupid communist, doesn't get along with two African American students, but gets along with the other 3 and they follow him because he is the Alpha of the whole Sophmore class. 

Bursts out all the time. I recently went to other teachers to find out their methods. Find out they all hate him, kick him out of class all the time, has transferred multiple classes because teachers can't handle him. Dean basically said the same thing.

Me:
I have asked him to be a leader of the class. I have asked him to be more mature. Works for a little and then goes back to his behavior by end of the week.

Final straw:

I did a seating chart specifically because  of him and he looked around the class and said I divided up all the black students he gets along with because of ""racism"" and I am a racist. 

I talked to him about it and put it back on him and said I divided everyone up because he doesn't work well with anyone in the class and he distracts the other 3 AA students he gets along with.  ""He said he got it"" Still very frustrating to be called a racist because of a seating chart.

I always reference they can see these portions of the lecture on my course website but of course because I teach in a Title 1 school a lot of kids claim they don't have computer access or even a smart phone at home.  

Thus, what I have tried with little perceived success is using summarizing strategies like ""listen to the lecture and write a summarizing sentence or paragraph related to these less significant concepts.

So fellow World History teachers or Social Studies or teachers in general I am looking for your feedback, thoughts, or strategies that help you summarize less significant dense material with effective note-taking practices.

And no, I will not give print-outs because I believe this to be lazy teaching. :)",448,compound,0.9769,2016

I'm a paraeducator working with middle schoolers as a mentor (goal is to become a school counselor).  I try to be very intentional with my words to avoid implying things I don't mean to say and to convey my meaning in the best possible way, which is why I'm asking this question that might sound trivial to you.  

**What is the best way to introduce students to new or unfamiliar words when having an informal conversation with them?** (i.e. not in a classroom setting, but in a one-on-one or small group setting.)  I want to make sure my messages are getting through to kids, but sometimes I end up using more advanced words than they are used to.  I also want to avoid making students feel like I think they're stupid or that they aren't meeting my expectations.

For example, today I was talking to a kid about conflict and I used the word ""retaliate""^*, when I realized I didn't know whether my students were likely to be familiar with that word (I do not have formal training in education yet).

I ended up asking, ""Do you know what that word means?""  but later realized that sometimes kids feel obligated to say ""yes"" because the phrasing of the question makes them think they *should* know what it means, even if they actually don't.

I was thinking of more possible questions to use, like ""Have you heard that word before?""  But I don't want them to think that I think they're stupid if it's a word they use all the time.

I am almost definitely overthinking this, as I tend to do that... but I'd still love to hear your thoughts and insight.  Does anyone have any go-to phrases they use to introduce new words without making unnecessary implications?

C) An interview for another council close by, also next week. They don't often advertise positions and they are not as desperate for cover. However, if I could get in I would consider working here long term.

I just recently finished the interview process for my first full time teaching job and I could really use some positive vibes. (Sorry for any formatting I'm currently on my mobile)

I just recently graduated college and I am pursuing a career in teaching. As of now I am currently attending Grad school to receive a Graduate Certificate in my field, and I have been working as a part time teacher at a local learning center.

I applied for an open teaching position and was called in for an interview. The principals realized I had no real classroom teaching experience (graduated with a Bachelors of Arts in Anthropology). They invited me back for another interview where I provided them with a mock lesson to show how I would handle teaching a lesson on my own. 
To make a long story short, I nailed it! The principals gave me great feedback and we all had a good time during the process. After the lesson was done, they sat me down and told me what to expect at their school. The way they were talking to me, I thought I was going to get the offer right there. 

But to my surprise, they told me that they still had some things to look over and advised me to make sure my references were in. (The online application for the school system has a section where you list reference's emails and an online survey is sent to them to fill it out.) One principal gave me her card, and told me to let her know when my referendes were in. 

3 days after my mock lesson, my references were in and I emailed both principals to give a heads up. I told them to let me know if they needed anything else, and that I look forward to hearing from them. I got no response from either, so I decided to make a phone call as one of the principals advised. I called at my earliesr convenience, but got her voicemail. So I left a short message that we similar to my email. 

Now that I have reached out, the wait is literally killing me. I am constantly checking my email awaiting a response. The position starts in less than 2 weeks, so this is all I can think about. I am trying my best to be patient. 

Based on the information provided, does anybody think I will come through with the job? What are some things I can do to stop the constant stress over the wait?

I'm a third-year teacher that started the year in mid-October due to maternity leave. The transition back was mostly good (except for the fact that I'm more of a stickler to the rules than my long term sub, but that is not a huge nor important issue), and I have really clicked with most of my students.

Some background is probably helpful for this situation, as well. I teach 8th grade Dual Language, in which students who speak English or Spanish as their native language learn both languages simultaneously. Since I have the kids in 8th grade, their last year of the program, I have kids who are either fully embracing the program or completely rejecting it due to it being their last year. All in all, I enjoy the group because they're all very familiar with each other. However, their closeness is the problem.

I have two students in the same class that are native English speakers. One has decent Spanish skills and the other struggles tremendously. While that's not exactly the issue, every time I change the seating chart or say something they don't agree with, I get the worst attitude possible back as a response. They will complain aloud their grievances (that they want to sit together... yet I won't let that happen because they are not productive) and have a very piss-poor attitude as a result toward everything we do in class. Both will refuse to want to do work, but eventually get around to it because they do ""care"" about their grade, not so much the learning aspect. I can deal with that, but they both are building a resentment to learning and that makes me sad more than anything. 

The Friday before winter break, the kids were going on their break (block scheduling) and they were talking bad about their seats (I can't recall what they were saying exactly) and I finally said something in response. ""Listen, I can't please everyone when I make a seating chart. I don't have enough room in the class, there's way too many students, and it's impossible to sit everyone next to whom they would prefer to work with."" They stopped talking, even though I saw them look at each other and they both silently shook their heads. I then gave their biweekly reflection, which provides the kids to tell me about the class and what's going on in their life.

Holy cow. I have never felt so attacked in my life by a student. Reading those two girls' responses made me livid. I was accused of lying, told that I let everyone in the class sit next to their best friends but never them, and that they're the only ones every working in their groups (which is a lie...). I've heard kids say bad things behind my back, but this was direct to me. I don't understand the sense of entitlement or the fact that they feel they can say these things without consequence. Also, two weeks prior they wrote something similar that I yell at them (I don't) and spoke very poorly of another girl in the class (that is very quiet and probably doesn't deserve that type of ridicule).

I'm kind of at a loss at what to do or say. Ideally, I would prefer to do a schedule change and separate the girls (they're too toxic together), but that will reflect poorly on me and then I would have a class of 32 (I don't want to do that). I'm thinking about contacting parents, but I have a feeling that the parents might be enablers and probably don't think their student is doing anything wrong. 

How I do seating charts is through a website called Happy Class App. I put in the seating arrangement, students, and then indicate which students work well together and which ones don't work well together. I gather this data from what the STUDENTS tell me and just put in the information of who doesn't work well together. Funny thing is, most students say they don't work well with these two girls (gee I wonder why).

What I was accused of lying about was the seating chart. I said that the computer generates it for me, but then she heard me say to someone that it took over an hour to make and because of that reason I'm not making any changes. I did indeed work on it for about an hour (program is somewhat slow to load, and there were a lot of students...). The program arranges the seats to achieve ""optimal happiness"", even with so many constraints. Their class's seating chart was rated at 87% happiness. With 29 students, that means 25 will be happy and 4 will not be due to the arrangement.  

At this point, I'm not sure what I'm even trying to fix with these students. It seems that they are used to getting their way and they've become accustomed to speaking their mind without thought of whether or not it's appropriate or the right thing to do. My preference is that they stop focusing on their seat and focus on their learning. What should be my next course of action?

I'm a junior in high school who was home-schooled until the eighth grade. I'm third in my class (of maybe 115?), in all honors classes with straight As, and a varsity athlete. I go to a kind of small school in a relatively rural but not overly hillbilly-ish area, and we consistently score well on standardized tests/evaluations/et cetera. What I'm getting at is that we're not some crappy school with gang issues and violence and cops prowling around or something. I'm also in NHS and Boy Scouts. I say all of this not because I have a weird complex that makes me want to brag to teachers I've never met on some random subreddit, but to establish why I'm annoyed at what I'm about to talk about here.

All but maybe 4 of the roughly 30 teachers I've had so far have been incredibly suspicious of their students, me included, for probably the first four to eight weeks of class, and some remain that way for most of the year. I understand that it's easy to become jaded after dealing with just one or two morons per year over a decades-long teaching career, but I still find it pretty hard to come up with a justification for even the nicest teachers I've had doing things like giving people detentions for pulling their phones out 10 seconds (not an expression, I'm literally talking about less than the duration of 91,926,317,700 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom) before the bell rings, or yelling at a guy to ""stop playing on his phone below his desk"" when it's clearly and obviously sitting face down on the corner of said desk. It feels like a few of them sincerely want to find something to be angry about more than they want to teach, which, despite the fact that I know  it not to be the case, is a pretty upsetting sentiment to get from a teacher. We (and by ""we"" I mean my classmates, my parents, and my awesome German teacher) laugh under our breaths at and casually dismiss the disturbing irony of our calculus teacher spending twenty minutes (VERY slight hyperbole) ranting about all the ways STUDENTS like to waste class time, but the fact remains that it's really no way for a teacher (or anybody else, for that matter) to be acting, and it is unfortunately not all that uncommon at our school.

I don't want this to be construed as some kind of personal vendetta against teachers or the ramblings of a kid who's burned up about getting in trouble over a phone (for the record, I have yet to get in any kind of trouble at school), and I don't even have words for the amount of respect I have for teachers as a whole, because I know it can be a low-paying, aggravating, sometimes unappreciated job, but I've seen stuff like this in everybody from a first-year Health teacher to a goofball Government teacher who couldn't be bothered to use spellcheck on anything he typed to a Biology/Chemistry teacher a year from retirement who wasn't even required to take the school technology orientation because he was so close to being done. Given the borderline universal nature of the types of attitudes I'm talking about here, I get the feeling that they are not unique to any particular kind of person, or by any means to my school alone.

I guess my question ultimately boils down to this: Why are so many teachers inherently mistrustful, even at a great school with great students, and what can I do to gain their trust a little earlier in the year than midterms? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

TLDR:
Teachers at my school are, in a word, cynical, regardless of their age, experience, subject, or the types of kids they teach. (I still have a ton of respect for teachers as a whole; this is not meant as an attack.) Advice?

10th Grade World History teacher who is seeking advice on how to have students take notes more effectively. At the beginning of the semester I advise students to take notes via the Cornell Method. Of course well into the semester only a few students continue taking notes through this strategy. If a student doesn't want to utilize this method than that is fine with me.

But a little bit of background will help you understand my central question.. World History is a super dense course and there is really only time for me to implement formative assessments related to the Standard Learning Objective that is tied to the state test. Thus, a lot of material needs to be skimmed. When I try to fly through this material, that is largely skimmed over on summative assessments (quizzes, tests) and maybe will have one question related to each less significant concept, students get lost and complain they do not have enough time to get the material down. 

I always reference they can see these portions of the lecture on my course website but of course because I teach in a Title 1 school a lot of kids claim they don't have computer access or even a smart phone at home.  

Thus, what I have tried with little perceived success is using summarizing strategies like ""listen to the lecture and write a summarizing sentence or paragraph related to these less significant concepts.

So fellow World History teachers or Social Studies or teachers in general I am looking for your feedback, thoughts, or strategies that help you summarize less significant dense material with effective note-taking practices.

The overall goal for this course is to help students who are not familiar with the computer become more comfortable with it and gain skills that they can put on their resumes. I usually do a 20-30 minute lesson at the beginning of class to review material as well as to introduce new items. Generally my lessons cannot go longer as my students cannot follow it, they are all ESL and I find shorter lessons work best. My classroom is a computer lab and once I have given the lesson, my students are to work on an exercise that reaffirms the lesson. Unless my students have questions I usually sit at my computer and do my own work such as planning or marking. I feel weird walking around the room when my students are working.

Hope everyone's New Years went well.

I am a senior in a teacher education program in Rhode Island, and after graduation I would like to get a job teaching in Massachusetts (specifically in Boston). I'm a little confused about how to go about getting licensed.

A little about me: I am getting certified to teach Math for 5-12 in Rhode Island. My student teaching experiences will be in urban districts, with large ELL populations.

I know to be certified I have to take the MTEL (Comm. and Lit, and Mathematics). I also noticed for the Initial License I would have to get an SEI endorsement which can be done through MTEL as well.

I'm a little confused on when I should be doing things. Should I take all the MTELs BEFORE I apply for jobs? or after? Which ones should I take? Should I not bother with the SEI test and just get the Preliminary license which doesn't require it?

The reason I ask is because Boston Public Schools does a hiring pool and didn't want to be ""disqualified"" from any positions because I don't meet initial requirements. But seeing as I haven't graduated yet...does it matter?

Would like some guidance.

I have two reading classes: one with my homeroom kids, and one with the math teacher's kids. Prior to Thanksgiving break, it was structured where I had my homeroom in the morning for ELA and the math teacher's kids after lunch for ELA. My homeroom kids were focused, with it, and trying their hardest, while my second class was some sort of hellish nightmare. I had students talking back, being too loud, interrupting, not transitioning appropriately, etc. That group is a challenge for everyone who has them (except the math teacher, aka their homeroom, because she's very very very strict and many of the students have said they're afraid of her.) I'm in my first year so I'm still trying to bridge the gap between being too lenient and being just lenient enough to be considered fair. My CT during student teaching was very strict and yelled a lot and I was so afraid of being that teacher that I was a bit too lenient. 

Due to issues with a different 4th grade teacher we had to switch schedules the week we came back from Thanksgiving break. Now the hellish class comes in the morning and my homeroom is after lunch. I thought all my problems would be solved, and partially, they were. Now the hellish class is my favorite. In the morning they're still kind of tired but more willing to focus and most behavior problems have been seriously cut back. I'm seeing much more effort from them than before. 

However, now that my homeroom class gets ELA in the afternoon, everything has gone to hell with them. They're not as focused, they talk, get off task easily, don't pay attention, etc. I gave them from Thanksgiving break to Christmas break to get it together and get used to the transition. Now we're back and we set goals/resolutions, reviewed procedures, and I added new pieces to my reward system. I use ClassDojo and the students earn points (and can lose points). They spend their points on reward coupons which they all seem to be very interested in. In addition to that, there's school-wide PBS in place, but I found the events to be too spread out and not well organized (we didn't have any events for like 2 months.) 

Today I tried to be really strict with them. I put my foot down and I was consistent (for once, I struggled with that at the beginning of the year) and I feel like some of the kids are resenting me now because of it. I want to be fair, but at the same time, they KNOW the rules and procedures and they should be following them this late in the game. I'm not sure what to do with my homeroom now. They were excited about the coupons but only a handful of them actually worked toward earning points. I know I've been too lenient with them in the past and it's biting me in the ass now.

I've been teaching AP Physics for three years and I just recently accepted a job offer for a high(ish) level employee at an ad agency in Chicago. I came to you guys for advice and I can't give enough gratitude for your comments and support. I've struggled a lot with this decision, but at the end of the day, I have to start looking at what the best move would be for my professional career -- as Chicago Public Schools isn't a place that instills great confidence for security. CPS is going to get a lot worse before it gets better and that really scares me, as well as the majority of teachers teaching in Chicago. I'm 24, male and I want to make sure I have enough security for long term career, personal and financial goals.

So our first semester ends February 5th and I need your advice one last time before I clock out:

1. Should I tell my principal in person or email them a letter of resignation? I have a letter written up, but I want to tell him to his face, man-to-man, and shake his hand after telling and thanking him.

2. I've got about a month left with my students. When should I break it to them? I want it to be an appropriate time because I'm pretty sure I'm going to tear up when I tell them. I'd die for my students and they'd die for me. I love them and it makes me want to throw up thinking that I'm leaving them with some random person I don't know. Ugh

3. Would you guys come back to your students and visit them from time to time? Is that super taboo, coming back to visit your students either in class or at a school sporting event, etc?

4. Does it get easier missing your students? My heart feels really heavy and I'm so sad to leave them. I feel bad and I feel like I'm letting them down. I love them so much. Teachers who have left, did you get the same feeling?

And granted the Seminar will probably take some of my anxieties away but i am setting here freaking out a bit and need to vent. 

So i talked to my supervising teacher today and he seems like a great guy and i am sure he will be able to offer a lot of help. But i am still super anxious and scared. For starters I'm a planner, i like plans and lists and having everything down to the minute. But i don't have the course curriculum yet so I'm worried about covering to much or not enough. And I'm worried about making my lessons to short.

Also the workload is kind of scary. Right now i am just picturing myself staying up to midnight or later trying to come up with lessons for the kids to do. I don't have a social life so that isn't going to get in the way. But i don't really want to complain about that because complaining about that just seems like whining to me.

Also the lessons scare me because lesson planning was my least favorite part and i would even say my worst part. I have always hated group activities and even for individual ones i don't feel like i am creative enough to come up with enough things to do each day every day. And my teacher said he likes to only do 20 minutes of lecture with for or five activities the rest of the time.

Not to mention i was AP everything but Maths so i have to try and learn to make work for kids who aren't on the college pathway. I need to make sure the lessons and assignments are not so hard that no one is getting it but at the same time cover enough so that the student's know whats going on. 

Also I'm worried on how I will be graded. There will be observers some days along with the teacher hisself. And I know im just starting out so their will be mistakes but i don't have anyone else to measure myself against and have know idea how the observers will see my work and mistakes. I mean they are suppose to be there to help me, and i am sure they will give advice on what i need to change. But I'm just worried because it seems really abstract and subjective and I am much better with hard markers and expectations.

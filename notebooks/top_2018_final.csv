For whatever reason they were talking about how long a person should still be allowed to live at home after college. One said 25 is the cutoff, and one said the parents shouldn’t allow their kid to move back in with them at all because it’s just allowing the kid to be lazy. There were some other comments but I won’t repeat the whole thing. One of them turned to me and said “how long are you gonna live at home for?” I just kinda smiled and said I wasn’t sure. This is not the only time I’ve gotten comments like this. Just a couple weeks ago someone else said to me “don’t you ever think about moving out of your parents’ house?” I know they aren’t trying to be rude, but it’s hard to talk about.

You see, I’m 25 and in my 3rd year of teaching, an I still live at home. It isn’t because I can’t afford to move out, and it isn’t because I don’t want to. I live at home with a mother who has been clinically depressed for the last two years, and who insists that her life is over because she is adamant that no amount of therapy or medication would ever help her, so she refuses treatment. She has not spoken to any of her family or friends in the last two years because she insists that she’s already “labeled” as being crazy. I live at home with a father who tries to help my mom, but has run out of ideas how to do so, and who I know relies on me being the only person he can hold a normal conversation with when he gets home from work. I have two brothers, but one of them is away at college and the other lives out of state. He moved for a job last year, and I saw what that did to my mom who was already depressed, and I know that I can’t do that to her, too. (For the record, I’m not blaming him- he had a fabulous job opportunity that he would have been foolish to pass up). Collectively, we’ve got no idea how to help Mom if she won’t accept help. We don’t know what triggered the depression two years ago either because she won’t tell us. There are times when I feel like a prisoner- I would love to be out living on my own. I make enough money even with paying back college loans, but I know if I left, she would spiral even deeper into depression, and I would feel guilty for leaving my Dad to deal with this on his own.

I don’t like to talk about this with many people. One older teacher on my team whom I often go to for advice knows, but I mostly don’t talk about it. Not because I don’t trust my team but because it’s just hard to talk about and isn’t something that I would just bring up in a conversation.

Here is why:

1. **They are young enough to have fun with, but old enough to handle more challenging themes.** My homeroom class, as an example, still dresses up for Halloween at school, watches cartoons, likes to play Heads Up, 7 Up, etc. Yet, when we read *The Secret Life of Walter Mitty*, they were able to diagnose Walter Mitty with Maladaptive Daydreaming AND discuss various medical treatments that could help him establish stability both in the workplace and at home. They were able to create utopias and then use dystopian themes to destroy them. I just love watching them enjoy the playful and silly things, but have ""real"" talk too.
2. **They are sassy, but still scared of you...and their parents.** I am a sarcastic person. I know that most ""how to not suck at teaching"" books tell you to avoid sarcasm in the classroom, but these authors have clearly never been around a middle schooler. For me, it's all about the rapport you have with the students. There are some students who I would NEVER use sarcasm with...and some students who I have to verbally destroy daily. They NEED it. They LOVE it. I love this age of occasionally pushing the envelope, but knowing when it's TOO much. My students know what they can be sassy about and what I will absolutely not tolerate. 
3. **I play a crucial role in their development as human beings.** It is such an honor knowing that they are at an age where they not only seek my opinion of their actions and decisions, but they WANT my approval. This is the age when they make mistakes. They learn from them. I play a big part in that learning. I like to think that the ""bad ones"" aren't completely bad yet. I have watched many ""bad"" kids change for the better thanks to some TLC and \(a lot of\) attention from their middle school teachers.
4. **Um, they're hilarious?** Whether they're intentionally hilarious or not, they are hilarious. They make me laugh every single day. The questions they ask? Absurd. The stories they tell? Absurd. The adorable awkwardness? Absurd. I have an endless arsenal of stories to tell at parties thanks to my hilarious students.
5. **They still have big dreams.** Most of my students plan to be professional athletes... some of whom do not even play a sport.
6. **I'm a celebrity.** If I see my students ANYWHERE...the grocery store, my dentist's office, around campus, in my nightmares...they FREAK out. I am Taylor freaking Swift and every single middle schooler becomes a fan. It is not uncool to say hi to me. I like that.

No, I don't think your story about how you were so horrible to a teacher you made her cry is hilarious. No I don't feel any differently about it when you explain that ""she was a bitch though"". No your explanation of her behaviour to try and justify your treatment of her does not excuse what you did.

All I hear is a story of a teacher who was probably stressed, possibly a new teacher or just someone who needed help with classroom management, or someone who had had enough and snapped. I feel so sorry for her that because she tried to be stern her students decided that justified going out of their way to ""make her life hell"". 

I understand possibly not knowing better as a teen (although my teen self would never have treated a teacher like that) but I don't see how you can look back on that behaviour as an adult and not have grown. How can you have so little empathy for someone that you *laugh* about how you tormented them until they cried? 

And while we are on the dating tips... don't tell teachers how to teach if you're not a teacher, especially if your advice was not asked for!

I'm still excited to go back in the fall, and I very much enjoy my job.  But a couple of things have happened already this year that are putting me in a negative mood and I haven't even gone back yet.  

When you're a new teacher, you'll often be warned to 'stay away from the cranky older teachers who always have a problem with things.  Especially new things - they are stuck in the past and don't want to change, they are burnt out and should probably retire instead of sticking around.'  

Here's a perspective from someone who isn't all THAT old and is totally willing to try new things - but now I'm starting to see the wisdom of the elders.

You will hear about silver bullets.  You will be told that they will fix all problems, that test scores will rise, that you will have better classroom management, that all students will be successful - if only you follow the new method.  If it doesn't work for you, you probably weren't following it 100%.  Or you did it wrong.  Because it's a silver bullet, and someone in some school that may look nothing like your school or your students was successful with it, it will certainly work in all schools.  

You may think the silver bullet sounds good.  You may like parts of it.  You will hear things like ""we need all stakeholders to buy in, it's a paradigm shift but if we can think outside the box we can fulfill our mission statement"" and tons of buzzwords.  You may leave the training excited to try the new thing.  

And it may even work!  It may help you with whatever issues you might have.  Some kids might do better, some things might be easier.  And then when you get used to the new method, guess what?

You'll have a new method.  A new silver bullet.  The old silver bullet will be discarded and the paradigm will shift to the new guru and new method.  This might be 2 years after the first silver bullet, it might be 3 or 4.  But it will almost certainly not be after a long enough period of time to actually see if the first one worked or not.  But the admin will be on board, the new teachers will be excited, and everyone will get 4 more hours of PD.

Eventually, you'll realize that *there are really no silver bullets*.  You'll get sick of meetings about it and sick of being told that this one magic technique will change everything.  It never does, and even if it did -  you would never really have a chance to find out, since admin and district powers that be never want to stick with anything long enough to really know.  So you'll start tuning things out, and pretty soon you will be the 'cranky, burnt out teacher who should just retire.'  

It's not being burnt out, it's experience and self-preservation. It's conserving energy for things that actually work and won't be replaced by the latest and greatest next year.

**What prompted this tirade?**

I know this is long and ranty, but I'm really angry about it.  We started a program a couple of years ago where students would have one class period a day with a teacher who would basically counsel them and advise them.  The rationale was that these students would have 4 years with the same teacher, they would build relationships and the students would have an adult on campus who really knew and cared about them - so they would have someone to talk to about things when necessary.  I got my group of freshmen 2 years ago.  I've worked with them now for 2 years, guiding them through their first year - getting on them weekly for any grade issues, talking to them about their plans for after high school, helping them decide where they might want to apply to college, etc.  This year is their junior year and I had plans to work on preparing for the ACT, etc.  I was looking forward to next year when they would be visiting colleges, applying for scholarships, etc.  And of course, seeing MY kids graduate after 4 years of working with them.  For some reason, the admin decided to shuffle ALL teachers and ALL kids this year.  So I don't have MY kids, I have a new class of freshmen.  OK, fine...I have nothing against these new kids.  But I want to know what happened to building relationships and having an adult on campus that they could talk to?  That doesn't matter any more?  My kids are going to be PISSED.  They moved a few of them into an honors advisory last year and those kids were angry - I can only imagine how they'll react when they find out they've been moved yet again, for no reason other than because someone felt like it.  The worst part is that now that I know that students can and will be shuffled at any time, for any reason or none at all, it makes me not want to do more than the minimum for the new kids.  Not because I don't like them, but because I'm just another teacher to them, and next year it will be a new teacher.  Why bother asking them about their plans after graduation when that is 4 years away and I won't see them after this year?

To add to that, after spending several years writing a curriculum for our program, the summer group basically threw it out and said ""the curriculum is now units 1-6 in the textbook.""  We now have a unit of farm animal vocabulary as part of the first year foreign language curriculum. Why?  Not because it's useful, high-frequency vocabulary - but because it's in unit 4. We no longer have words like bathroom, bedroom, kitchen or house in the curriculum because those are in unit 7 and the curriculum is units 1-6. If I follow the curriculum, my kids won't be able to ask where the bathroom is, but at least they'll be able to discuss sheep and geese.

1. Research prior the interview. If you have been in summer mode or have been out of the loop for a while, then please read over your own resume and research/ use few key words about the position you are applying to and/or the school you are applying to.

2. No matter how boring interviewing is, don’t cross your arms!

3. Please don’t check your phone or text during any part of the interview. If you must for an emergency, excuse yourself.

4. Be prepared to give specific examples of what you DO, did or want to do. Specific books, specific activities, specific crafts, specific class management techniques by name! 

5. Ask for a tour of the school!!!

6. Pretend like you already work there and speak in terms of what you would do in the actual school. It gives the panel a good feeling that you actually want to work there.

7. Be honest! Own your lack of experience! We are hiring a woman that have been a SAHM for years and has no experience in the field but her cover letter and her personality was unique, candid, fun and honest. She is getting a job.

8. Please don’t say cliche things like “you have a passion for teaching”. That will not make you stand out, everyone says that and some panelists may even roll their eyes.

9. Some panel members can be royal Asholes and are trying to make you uncomfortable because they are miserable human beings. Beware of them and don’t feel intimidated. 

10. Be on time. And By on time I mean 10 minutes early. Use the spare time to socialize with the front desk staff. When I got hired, I saw the secretaries stomped putting together some flier packets. I jumped into action and volunteer to help. When the Principal came to get me, I was on the floor sorting out thousands of fliers giggling with the rest of the staff. I got the job. 

11. Even if you are of shy nature, try your best to be assertive. It is OK to bring index cards and ask for the question to be repeated if you don’t understand.

Now, I'd not been feeling well over the last couple days but what was wrong just didn't make sense.  I was just trying to keep pushing through the stuff that needed to be done when my daughter came home from school yesterday and we were chatting away happily on our driveway.  Out of the blue, my daughter interrupted me, with a very serious look on her face and said ""Mom, I'm sorry to cut you off but you really need to know right now that your eyes are turning yellow.  You need to call your doctor right away as I think you have jaundice.""  To say that was surprising to hear from your 16 year old kid who usually struggles to figure out how to keep her room clean is an understatement. Uncertain, I walked over to one of our neighbors and asked him to look at my eyes and tell me what he saw.  He looked and although he and I had talked several times that day, he appeared startled and said ""Mild jaundice.  Call your doctor.""  

Now my 16 year old was behind me, patiently awaiting my realizing that yes, she was correct in that my eyes were in fact, turning yellow with her phone in her hand ready.  ""Mom, we should take a picture and send it to your doctor so they can see your eyes, too"".  So there I stood, getting my eye photographed by my daughter in her equally bright idea.

Leaning over my shoulder, she helped me write the email to my doctor (!!) and in record time, I received a reply to set up an appointment for today to get evaluated for jaundice.  I went in today and sure enough, I was diagnosed with jaundice.  Even my doctor wanted to know how my daughter recognized jaundice so rapidly.  To show you how rapid, this was the photo my daughter took yesterday as the *jaundice was just starting to show up*.  My eyes are a little more yellow today but we still have time.

My daughter's answer:  ""My health teacher, Ms. Mix, taught us all about jaundice last year and how to recognize it.""

A little yellow tinge and bam, my daughter knew it was potentially jaundice and that I needed to be seen because of the meds I'm on--**all because of a teacher**.  Teachers are pretty amazing.  Ms. Mix has made the difference between being scared last night and oddly calm today because we have something that doesn't usually happen when jaundice occurs.  We have time. 

Ms. Mix is getting a special thank you from my daughter tomorrow at school.  I've already said thank you on her school's page.  As a parent, I have always appreciated what teachers do for our kids; however, I can honestly say that I've never been more grateful for teachers in my entire life than I am today.  

Thank you to all of you.  You have a tough job.  You don't get paid enough.  (Not nearly enough!) And all too often, I see memes about how you're not teaching anything that's useful anymore.  Next time I see one of my friends post something like that, I'm going to tell them to say that to my yellow eyed face.  

I love you all.  Thanks for being teachers.

Our high school had an active shooter drill complete with a fake gun, cop cars, evacuations...the whole deal. When one school goes on a lock down, the other schools near it do too. 

One of my 2nd grade students was going to the bathroom when the lockdown happened. I *knew* she where to hide, but I was worried she would get scared and come out before the lockdown was over. We are used to short, 3-5 min lockdowns where we hear the sound and practice hiding. This was over 20 mins and involved many people going around the halls rattling door knobs. My brave student stayed hidden in the bathroom the whole time and didn't come out until I came to get her. She was scared and a little teary, but she did exactly the right thing. She was the hero for the day. The other students and teachers told her how brave she was and how proud they were.

Our high school had an active shooter drill complete with a fake gun, cop cars, evacuations...the whole deal. When one school goes on a lock down, the other schools near it do too. 

One of my 2nd grade students was going to the bathroom when the lockdown happened. I *knew* she where to hide, but I was worried she would get scared and come out before the lockdown was over. We are used to short, 3-5 min lockdowns where we hear the sound and practice hiding. This was over 20 mins and involved many people going around the halls rattling door knobs. My brave student stayed hidden in the bathroom the whole time and didn't come out until I came to get her. She was scared and a little teary, but she did exactly the right thing. She was the hero for the day. The other students and teachers told her how brave she was and how proud they were.

________________________________________________________________

**A.  Asymmetric Effort - Don't get stuck working harder than the kids**

Spending two hours creating a powerpoint that takes thirty minutes to present is a good example of working harder than the kids.  Not only did you ""lose"" time by spending more time creating it than you ""gain"" when presenting it, you have done all the heavy lifting for that lesson.  The kids will be passive learners for that lesson, which equates to less comprehension and retention.  You're also wrecked at the end of the day from standing and delivering for five or six straight periods.

*Solution*:  Create lessons that are less work on your part by making students active participants.

Guided work - Give them an outline that is missing key information, and a source which contains the info.  You can do this in the form of a simple handout or a more complex foldable/timeline/chart/whatever.  You can extend the activity and check for understanding by having them produce something as a formative assessment.  They can create a cartoon, storyboard, RAFT, or answer an open-ended question.  Exit tickets or following-day bellwork are also good ways to check their understanding and get them working without effort on your part.

You can follow this basic framework 20 different ways without ever doing the same thing twice.

*Examples*:

-Social Contract - Have students create a contract for a government.  What are they willing to give up, what do they expect to get in return? 

-Bill of Rights - Give them an incomplete chart and have them fill in the blanks.  Extension:  Pick two amendments and create a short comic explaining how those rights affect them.

-Elections - Create a timeline from candidacy announcement to swearing in.  Extension:  Create a fake campaign for mayor.  What issues would you focus on for your campaign.

-Federal Spending - Create a pie chart showing current levels of government spending.  Extension:  What is the difference between mandatory and discretionary spending?  What surprised you the most?  What would you change and why?  Etc.

-Arguments for the Constitution - Have them create a compare and contrast chart.  Extension:  Imagine the Constitution was to be ratified in today's visual media world.  Create a storyboard for a campaign commercial to convince a small or large state that the Constitution is better than the Articles of Confederation.

*Takeaway*:  Every time you are going to create something for the kids.  Ask yourself if they can create it themselves.

**B.  Create time for yourself - Every lesson isn't the best lesson ever.**

Sometimes everybody needs to work; they work at their desks while you work at yours.  There is this idea coming out of teacher training that every day needs to be this massively intricate, higher order lesson.  This is not true.  No one can sustain that level of effort while maintaining a healthy home life.  

I build time into every single week for them to do seatwork.  Are we doing some intricate socratic seminar thing for two days?  Am I collecting a lot of stuff that I need to grade?  Is it Thursday and I need some time?  Seatwork day.  Current Events?  Reflection?  Essay?  Read an article and respond?  I don't give a fuck.  They're going to work while I collect myself and get caught up.  

*Takeaway*:  Create time for yourself.  It can be grading time, planning time, or mental health time.  It doesn't matter.  Factor it into your week before you burn out.

**C.  Grading - Grade early, grade often, throw things away.**

You don't have to collect everything they do, and you don't have to grade everything you collect.  If they are working and producing a lot of things, you can easily let stuff slide without impacting their grade.  If it's the difference between grading another worksheet and going home, go home. 

Also, a lot of grading can take place before you collect it.  Are they working on a chart or something that is going to be a participation grade?  You know who's working and who isn't.  Circulate with a roster and mark things down.  Put the grades in while they do their exit ticket.  Congratulations, you're done grading before you even collect it.  

Occasionally you can have them self-grade.  Did they produce a campaign poster?  Give them the rubric and have them self grade and give a sentence about why they gave themselves the grade they did.  Then you just skim through and spot-check.  I don't do this for things worth a lot of points, but it helps blow through large piles of political cartoons and whatnot.  It also makes them reflect on the grading process, which is good.

All other grading takes place on the workdays you create for yourself.  I do not grade at home.  Full stop.

*Takeaway*:  Don't get lost in grading.

**D.  Summary - Put the work on the kids.**

They say that good chefs don't know recipes; they know techniques.  If you can stir-fry, you can create a dozen different meals.  The same is true of teaching strategies.  Focus on cultivating a few student-work-oriented strategies and put them to work on as many different lessons as you can. 

If you take anything away from this it is that you should shift work from yourself to the kids.  When in doubt, have them create something.  Even if it isn't the absolute best lesson in the world, having them create something is a good way to both give yourself time and have them interact with the material.  Once you have shifted the work to the kids, get your own work done.  Use your planning, use their seat time, and work smart.  Go home and have fun.

They were able to create utopias and then use dystopian themes to destroy them. I just love watching them enjoy the playful and silly things, but have ""real"" talk too.

They LOVE it. I love this age of occasionally pushing the envelope, but knowing when it's TOO much. My students know what they can be sassy about and what I will absolutely not tolerate. 
3. **I play a crucial role in their development as human beings.** It is such an honor knowing that they are at an age where they not only seek my opinion of their actions and decisions, but they WANT my approval. This is the age when they make mistakes. They learn from them. I play a big part in that learning. I like to think that the ""bad ones"" aren't completely bad yet. I have watched many ""bad"" kids change for the better thanks to some TLC and \(a lot of\) attention from their middle school teachers.
4. **Um, they're hilarious?** Whether they're intentionally hilarious or not, they are hilarious. They make me laugh every single day. The questions they ask? Absurd. The stories they tell? Absurd. The adorable awkwardness? Absurd. I have an endless arsenal of stories to tell at parties thanks to my hilarious students.
5. **They still have big dreams.** Most of my students plan to be professional athletes... some of whom do not even play a sport.
6. **I'm a celebrity.** If I see my students ANYWHERE...the grocery store, my dentist's office, around campus, in my nightmares...they FREAK out. I am Taylor freaking Swift and every single middle schooler becomes a fan. It is not uncool to say hi to me. I like that.

No, I don't think your story about how you were so horrible to a teacher you made her cry is hilarious. No I don't feel any differently about it when you explain that ""she was a bitch though"". No your explanation of her behaviour to try and justify your treatment of her does not excuse what you did.

All I hear is a story of a teacher who was probably stressed, possibly a new teacher or just someone who needed help with classroom management, or someone who had had enough and snapped. I feel so sorry for her that because she tried to be stern her students decided that justified going out of their way to ""make her life hell"". 

I understand possibly not knowing better as a teen (although my teen self would never have treated a teacher like that) but I don't see how you can look back on that behaviour as an adult and not have grown. How can you have so little empathy for someone that you *laugh* about how you tormented them until they cried? 

And while we are on the dating tips... don't tell teachers how to teach if you're not a teacher, especially if your advice was not asked for!

In Finland to become a teacher you have to do a master's degree in education.

1. Research prior the interview. If you have been in summer mode or have been out of the loop for a while, then please read over your own resume and research/ use few key words about the position you are applying to and/or the school you are applying to.

2. No matter how boring interviewing is, don’t cross your arms!

3. Please don’t check your phone or text during any part of the interview. If you must for an emergency, excuse yourself.

4. Be prepared to give specific examples of what you DO, did or want to do. Specific books, specific activities, specific crafts, specific class management techniques by name! 

5. Ask for a tour of the school!!!

6. Pretend like you already work there and speak in terms of what you would do in the actual school. It gives the panel a good feeling that you actually want to work there.

7. Be honest! Own your lack of experience! We are hiring a woman that have been a SAHM for years and has no experience in the field but her cover letter and her personality was unique, candid, fun and honest. She is getting a job.

8. Please don’t say cliche things like “you have a passion for teaching”. That will not make you stand out, everyone says that and some panelists may even roll their eyes.

9. Some panel members can be royal Asholes and are trying to make you uncomfortable because they are miserable human beings. Beware of them and don’t feel intimidated. 

10. Be on time. And By on time I mean 10 minutes early. Use the spare time to socialize with the front desk staff. When I got hired, I saw the secretaries stomped putting together some flier packets. I jumped into action and volunteer to help. When the Principal came to get me, I was on the floor sorting out thousands of fliers giggling with the rest of the staff. I got the job. 

11. Even if you are of shy nature, try your best to be assertive. It is OK to bring index cards and ask for the question to be repeated if you don’t understand.

My answer is typically that they either have (1) a bad resume format; or (2) they have little to no experience, which means their resume format should be reworked - see (1).

To generally help the frustrated out there with poor formats, I decided to share a [downloadable and editable Google doc ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6wHWkQ9yhEkdtQTDlzEV7eq7IkVHGQNdhOzLdCM_Sg/edit?usp=sharing)version in the hope that it helps those struggling with formatting issues. Hopefully many will find this useful.

P.S. As a long-time hiring manager and professional resume writer (Unfold Careers) who’s worked with many recruiters, this has been widely validated as readable and effective (and ATS friendly).

**Most Common Resume Advice I Give:**

* **Be More Precise.** Too often resumes come to me with vague descriptions, like “Was top salesperson in SaaS group."" While this may be true, push yourself to be more precise. What is the “top salesperson” denotation measured by? How many individuals are on the SaaS team? By what amount did you perform better than others on the team? For what period of time? Taking these into account, your description becomes something like: “Grossed highest sales in 25-member SaaS group for 2 years consecutively and improved SaaS team’s sales by 20%.” See the improvement? Don’t be afraid to bold the metrics throughout the resume.
* **Describe Your Impact.** I see many critiques pushing for “achievements” in a resume, which is often confusing to many who don’t have metric-based roles or don’t quantify their responsibilities. Instead, focus on your *impact*. Describe how your work on a project significantly impacted the company, role, or the team. Add that you were Employee of the Year in 2015 for developing an algorithm for improving the efficiency of incoming customer service ticket sorting and organization. The awards and achievements can be a separate section in the resume or within experience descriptions, depending on the length and organization of your resume.
* **One Page.** Try hard. Unless you have 10+ years of experience.
* **The 10 Second Refresh.** A hiring manager will review your resume for approximately 10 seconds or less. When you do this, what do you see? Your resume needs to SCREAM whatever roles, skills, and experience is required by the role you want.
* **Bullet Points.** I can't stress enough how hiring managers don't want to read huge blocks of text paragraphs on the resume. Break this up into manageable bites.
* **Explanations of Gaps.** It is better to have something on your resume rather than a gap showing unemployment. For example, a stay at home mom with a five year gap could fill in that space with: ""Starting in May 2013, I left \[COMPANY\] to work as a stay-at-home mom for my three children. During this time, I started my own local jewelry company, which became profitable after just 6 months, and I served as the lead planner for multiple charity events, raising over $75,000, for my children’s school.”
* **Remove Your Objective Summary.** Usually, this doesn’t add anything to the resume, and a hiring manager usually skips it (we’re busy people and don’t have time to read 100 resume summaries). If you keep it, which I’d recommend to explain varied experience, a career change, or other non-standard circumstances, I’d recommend 2 brief phrases – no more than 2 or 3 lines. I would state the number of years of experience you have doing \[usually your current role/type of practice\], some of your top skills/achievements, and finally point out the role you are seeking to describe why your skills/current role make you perfect for the role. Also, avoid using the 1st person.
* **Poor Action Words.** Reevaluate your descriptions. Read each one and think about what it REALLY means. For example, what does “Championed staff blogging” mean? Sometimes we get caught up using flowery language while losing the effect of the content. Often simplicity can drive stronger impressions because it’s understood what exactly you did. The hiring manager can then say – “oh, that’s exactly the skill I need for this position.”
* **Remove References.** References should not be on the resume. They should be provided when asked. I’d recommend creating a separate document with a similar heading as your resumé with your references and their contact information laid out.

My answer is typically that they either have (1) a bad resume format; or (2) they have little to no experience, which means their resume format should be reworked - see (1).

To generally help the frustrated out there with poor formats, I decided to share a [downloadable and editable Google doc ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6wHWkQ9yhEkdtQTDlzEV7eq7IkVHGQNdhOzLdCM_Sg/edit?usp=sharing)version in the hope that it helps those struggling with formatting issues. Hopefully many will find this useful.

P.S. As a long-time hiring manager and professional resume writer (Unfold Careers) who’s worked with many recruiters, this has been widely validated as readable and effective (and ATS friendly).

**Most Common Resume Advice I Give:**

* **Be More Precise.** Too often resumes come to me with vague descriptions, like “Was top salesperson in SaaS group."" While this may be true, push yourself to be more precise. What is the “top salesperson” denotation measured by? How many individuals are on the SaaS team? By what amount did you perform better than others on the team? For what period of time? Taking these into account, your description becomes something like: “Grossed highest sales in 25-member SaaS group for 2 years consecutively and improved SaaS team’s sales by 20%.” See the improvement? Don’t be afraid to bold the metrics throughout the resume.
* **Describe Your Impact.** I see many critiques pushing for “achievements” in a resume, which is often confusing to many who don’t have metric-based roles or don’t quantify their responsibilities. Instead, focus on your *impact*. Describe how your work on a project significantly impacted the company, role, or the team. Add that you were Employee of the Year in 2015 for developing an algorithm for improving the efficiency of incoming customer service ticket sorting and organization. The awards and achievements can be a separate section in the resume or within experience descriptions, depending on the length and organization of your resume.
* **One Page.** Try hard. Unless you have 10+ years of experience.
* **The 10 Second Refresh.** A hiring manager will review your resume for approximately 10 seconds or less. When you do this, what do you see? Your resume needs to SCREAM whatever roles, skills, and experience is required by the role you want.
* **Bullet Points.** I can't stress enough how hiring managers don't want to read huge blocks of text paragraphs on the resume. Break this up into manageable bites.
* **Explanations of Gaps.** It is better to have something on your resume rather than a gap showing unemployment. For example, a stay at home mom with a five year gap could fill in that space with: ""Starting in May 2013, I left \[COMPANY\] to work as a stay-at-home mom for my three children. During this time, I started my own local jewelry company, which became profitable after just 6 months, and I served as the lead planner for multiple charity events, raising over $75,000, for my children’s school.”
* **Remove Your Objective Summary.** Usually, this doesn’t add anything to the resume, and a hiring manager usually skips it (we’re busy people and don’t have time to read 100 resume summaries). If you keep it, which I’d recommend to explain varied experience, a career change, or other non-standard circumstances, I’d recommend 2 brief phrases – no more than 2 or 3 lines. I would state the number of years of experience you have doing \[usually your current role/type of practice\], some of your top skills/achievements, and finally point out the role you are seeking to describe why your skills/current role make you perfect for the role. Also, avoid using the 1st person.
* **Poor Action Words.** Reevaluate your descriptions. Read each one and think about what it REALLY means. For example, what does “Championed staff blogging” mean? Sometimes we get caught up using flowery language while losing the effect of the content. Often simplicity can drive stronger impressions because it’s understood what exactly you did. The hiring manager can then say – “oh, that’s exactly the skill I need for this position.”
* **Remove References.** References should not be on the resume. They should be provided when asked. I’d recommend creating a separate document with a similar heading as your resumé with your references and their contact information laid out. Also make sure your references are prepared to be contacted in the event you haven’t spoken to them in a while.

I thought I was losing my mind since I was doing the same thing as last year but felt so much more stress and anxiety. Now I won’t lie there are admin changes, an overcrowded school, disciplinary issues, however, it was more than that I felt like I was burning out faster than ever.

This past week our county did a “teach to contract” meaning only work from 7:15am to 2:45pm. No after school grading, no planning, no coming in early to help students. At first I was a little annoyed, how would I get things done?! Then the week happened and I heard everyone else involved saying the same thing. We were burning out. But I learned more than that.

My students care more than my educational board. They understood I didn’t have time to grade and they weren’t upset or bothered. They saw me rushing in my classroom as the bell rung and some ran to hold my door open for other students and would say “miss go set up! We’ve got the door and the projector on for you!”. My students even started ushering each other out at 2:35pm saying “she needs to go home stop stressing her out.” My admin didn’t melt down or scream at me for not working harder (that one is a weird fear I have). No parents got upset that grades weren’t going in as fast. I slept in and still made it early enough to beat the student carpool rush. I left earlier and had time to care for my home life and myself. 

I didn’t get a lot of planning or grading done, but my stress my anxiety and my fears have decreased so much I started to think “why did I let myself do those things?” I know the answer is my students. I do it for them. The thing is they wanted me to keep doing this to an extent.

Here are some basic facts and statistics about the state of education in AZ.
 Per pupil funding in AZ is half that of the national average. The national average is just north of $10k per students. Arizona is just north of $5k per student.

Back in 2008, AZ had $1.1 billion more in funding than we do now.

Class sizes are bigger than ever. Sites will lead you to believe that we have a 17:1 ratio when in actuality, that number is far larger. Try close to 27:1 and even 30:1.

Electives have been cut horrendously and core classes receive little to no budget. I know teachers who have suck over $1k into their class for supplies since the school has no budget for it. Parents in my district cannot afford to help even if they wanted to (this is a generalization.)

Teacher retention is down due to non-competitive wages with our neighbouring states. There are teachers who live in Yuma but work in Cali because the pay is better.

We lose funding due to private school vouchers allowing public education money to follow students who leave Public Ed for Private Ed but the money does not follow us back. If money is following students wherever they go, shouldn't it follow the student back into public ed? Around the end of the first semester, students in Private Ed run the risk of being dumped by their school because they did not meet their needs to keep their letter grades and ""looks"" up. We get those students in Public Ed back because of this.

Arizona has been sliding downhill for a long time. These are just numbers and statistics to show you why.

Our Governer's plan for a 20% raise for teachers by 2020 is not a good one at all. He plans to pull money from state Medicaid and Medicare as well as funding from programs that support Veteran's and the disabled to fund the teacher raise. The raise does not even address any of the issues that I stated above.

He wants to give $371k back to education from these cuts as well. If I know my math, $371k does not equal $1.1billion nor is it a plan to.

This is as much as I know and I did my best to my bias out as an educator.

You know what?  I will give you an A if you can define that term.  You know what?  Even better, I will give you an A, and go out and buy the most expensive pair of Durant sneakers I can find, fry them, and eat them, if you can use ""columbic"" in a sentence right now.

Oh, and you don't think I know how to highlight, then hit CTRL+C and then click on the search bar and hit CTRL+V and find word-for-word where you got that paragraph you copy-pasted into your lab report USING THE SAME GOD DAMNED FONT?

I’m just reflecting on it. 

I was reaching the end of student teaching, and the school I was working in had a few openings for the upcoming school year. I applied, and was asked to come in for an interview. 

The first round of interviews were speed dating style, conducted by a group of teachers at the school from different grade levels. I knew my CT would be helping to conduct interviews, as well as some of my team teachers. I had met every single one of the interviewers multiple times, many of whom I worked with on a daily basis.

In the days leading up to the interview, I asked my CT and team teachers how I should prep, what to expect, etc. They wouldn’t answer my questions and refused to give me any information. 

So the interview arrives, and the first person I meet with is a teacher from another grade level, who I have met before. However, she shakes my hand, introduces herself, and proceeds as if she’s never met me. I thought maybe she had forgotten meeting me. 

Then I sit down with one of my team teachers. Again, she shakes my hand, and introduces herself to me. At this point, I felt confused.  I didn’t expect any special treatment, and I knew they had to ask me the same questions they ask everyone else. But the treating me like a stranger thing was odd. 

Finally, I got around to my CT, who I have spent 8-10 hours a day with for the past four months. She proceeds to shake my hand, introduce herself, and describe her position in the school. She also asks questions like, “where are you currently teaching?” (Im thinking....is this a trick question? We literally taught a lesson together half an hour ago). Also, “how would your most recent supervisor describe you?” (Um...you are my most recent supervisor....should I just recite the feedback you gave me yesterday?)

I was just offered a position in instructional technology in my district, so I'll be helping teachers integrate technology in their classes. This year, I started feeling ready to leave the classroom, so this opportunity came at just the right time, and I'll still be in education, and I'll still get to work with students occasionally. 

August is definitely going to feel weird when I don't have a classroom to set up or lessons to plan. I really enjoyed creating engaging lessons, and I'm going to miss my students (in GT, I got the same students year after year, so I had some of them for 4 years). But the benefits outweigh what I'll miss. No more spending hundreds of dollars a year on class materials. No more morning/afternoon/lunch duties. No more dealing with parents. No more 12 hour days. No more field trips by myself. No more open house and curriculum night and meet the teacher night. No more discipline problems. No more teaching around assemblies and field trips and testing.

I was just offered a position in instructional technology in my district, so I'll be helping teachers integrate technology in their classes. This year, I started feeling ready to leave the classroom, so this opportunity came at just the right time, and I'll still be in education, and I'll still get to work with students occasionally. 

August is definitely going to feel weird when I don't have a classroom to set up or lessons to plan. I really enjoyed creating engaging lessons, and I'm going to miss my students (in GT, I got the same students year after year, so I had some of them for 4 years). But the benefits outweigh what I'll miss. No more spending hundreds of dollars a year on class materials. No more morning/afternoon/lunch duties. No more dealing with parents. No more 12 hour days. No more field trips by myself. No more open house and curriculum night and meet the teacher night. No more discipline problems. No more teaching around assemblies and field trips and testing. No more state testing.

Now I won’t lie there are admin changes, an overcrowded school, disciplinary issues, however, it was more than that I felt like I was burning out faster than ever.

This past week our county did a “teach to contract” meaning only work from 7:15am to 2:45pm. No after school grading, no planning, no coming in early to help students. At first I was a little annoyed, how would I get things done?! Then the week happened and I heard everyone else involved saying the same thing. We were burning out. But I learned more than that.

My students care more than my educational board. They understood I didn’t have time to grade and they weren’t upset or bothered. They saw me rushing in my classroom as the bell rung and some ran to hold my door open for other students and would say “miss go set up! We’ve got the door and the projector on for you!”. My students even started ushering each other out at 2:35pm saying “she needs to go home stop stressing her out.” My admin didn’t melt down or scream at me for not working harder (that one is a weird fear I have). No parents got upset that grades weren’t going in as fast. I slept in and still made it early enough to beat the student carpool rush. I left earlier and had time to care for my home life and myself. 

I didn’t get a lot of planning or grading done, but my stress my anxiety and my fears have decreased so much I started to think “why did I let myself do those things?” I know the answer is my students.

Here are some basic facts and statistics about the state of education in AZ.
 Per pupil funding in AZ is half that of the national average. The national average is just north of $10k per students. Arizona is just north of $5k per student.

Back in 2008, AZ had $1.1 billion more in funding than we do now.

Class sizes are bigger than ever. Sites will lead you to believe that we have a 17:1 ratio when in actuality, that number is far larger. Try close to 27:1 and even 30:1.

Electives have been cut horrendously and core classes receive little to no budget. I know teachers who have suck over $1k into their class for supplies since the school has no budget for it. Parents in my district cannot afford to help even if they wanted to (this is a generalization.)

Teacher retention is down due to non-competitive wages with our neighbouring states. There are teachers who live in Yuma but work in Cali because the pay is better.

We lose funding due to private school vouchers allowing public education money to follow students who leave Public Ed for Private Ed but the money does not follow us back. If money is following students wherever they go, shouldn't it follow the student back into public ed? Around the end of the first semester, students in Private Ed run the risk of being dumped by their school because they did not meet their needs to keep their letter grades and ""looks"" up. We get those students in Public Ed back because of this.

Arizona has been sliding downhill for a long time. These are just numbers and statistics to show you why.

Our Governer's plan for a 20% raise for teachers by 2020 is not a good one at all. He plans to pull money from state Medicaid and Medicare as well as funding from programs that support Veteran's and the disabled to fund the teacher raise. The raise does not even address any of the issues that I stated above.

He wants to give $371k back to education from these cuts as well. If I know my math, $371k does not equal $1.1billion nor is it a plan to.

This is as much as I know and I did my best to my bias out as an educator.

We get those students in Public Ed back because of this.

Arizona has been sliding downhill for a long time. These are just numbers and statistics to show you why.

Our Governer's plan for a 20% raise for teachers by 2020 is not a good one at all. He plans to pull money from state Medicaid and Medicare as well as funding from programs that support Veteran's and the disabled to fund the teacher raise. The raise does not even address any of the issues that I stated above.

He wants to give $371k back to education from these cuts as well. If I know my math, $371k does not equal $1.1billion nor is it a plan to.

This is as much as I know and I did my best to my bias out as an educator.

My school has been really rough this year. A lot of failing students that don't seem to care about their failures, abysmal attendance, a lot of disrespect being thrown my way, general school-wide disorganization. It's just been really tough.

Today, the seniors decided it was time to have their senior skip day. And as a teacher who only works with seniors I knew that this would typically be a day where you kind of have to throw up your hands and say ""Well, not much is going to be done today.""

In one class I had two students show up. I knew that one of the students (an IEP student) was enrolled in an online program that would replace his failing grade in my class and allow him to graduate on time. Essentially, it's doubled him up on English so if he fails one he can still get the credit from the other. It's good too because it allows a lot of students to engage with work outside of the generally negative culture of the school.

So he's playing an audiobook and reading along with Macbeth (which sadly wasn't included in my curriculum this year) and I hear him get past Act III, scene I and ask himself ""What's the deal with the First and Second Murderer? Where'd they come from."" I was taking some time and grading some papers but I decided to talk him through the plot developments. I wanted to test out my questioning skills. He had also previously told me he was supposed to compare how Macbeth was at the beginning of the play to how he is in Act III.

So I started by explaining some of the more difficult to understand language and helping him to summarize, and pointing out key lines where Macbeth indicates that Banquo is the murderers' enemy and also Macbeth's. So I asked ""Why would he be talking to them about Banquo being both of their enemies?"" And he answered that maybe Macbeth was thinking Banquo was going to kill him. He seemed to be a little confused about who Banquo and Duncan were, so I directed him to the character list and reoriented him to what happened in Act I ""who were the witches?"" ""they see the future"" ""what did they say to Macbeth?"" ""That he would be king."" ""what happened after that?"" ""Macbeth became king. He killed the king."" ""Okay cool, was anyone else with Macbeth when the witches told him this?"" ""..."" ""Look back at Act I, scene III, see who else is talking with Macbeth and the witches."" ""Banquo was there."" ""What do they say to him?"" [Student has a little trouble.] ""Look at where Banquo starts talking. After that the witches speak to him.

I'll spare you the rest of the line of questioning. After that I explained the difficult wording of ""not a king, but you will get kings"" to him (on reflection there is more nitty gritty questioning I could have done to get him there) and redirected him to the character list to find anyone related to Banquo.

By the end one of my absolute lowest students had made a prediction that Macbeth was going to kill Banquo and all of his children!

It wasn't perfect questioning, I over-explained in a couple of areas when I could have questioned him harder to get there, but it still just brightened my day. Seeing a student who can't write a comprehensible paragraph and usually relies on copying things straight from the book make a genuine and accurate plot prediction based on what he understands made me so happy!

I am an elementary special education paraeducator. I work with students whose situations run the gamut, all of whom have trouble being successful in gen ed classrooms. Our school has a 25% IEP rate - not including students on 504s or those who are needing to be or are currently being evaluated. My entire day is packed to the minute, and I've adjusted so that I have a 10 minute lunch because a new student came in and needs that time. The school district, which starts every successive year with deeper and deeper budget cuts, is saving a lot of money by having paras do this work.

It's worth it. They're worth it. I have a handful of students I worked with extensively at the beginning of the year who no longer need that time. Having them run up to me in the hall to tell me about a thing they did that day is everything.

People blame a lot of different factors for what they see as an epidemic of overdiagnosis - ADHD is caused by video games or autism is because of vaccines - and they miss it. 

Poverty and systemic oppression. Abuse and neglect. If a student comes to me in crisis the first thing I do is get eye level and do slow breathing until their lizard brain catches on and they mimic it and bring themselves back. The second thing I do is ask what they have eaten that day. 

The students who were born addicted to meth, with their small frames and heads and inability to regulate disappointment and anger. The homeless or tenuously housed kids who can't help but steal and hoard other students' resources. The kids who have to maintain the home because mom works three jobs who are too exhausted for circle time, let alone math. These are my kids.

I'm having a hard time today. I myself work four jobs, 80+ hours a week, with 7:30am-3pm in my para position. I work the other jobs because the district checks are only $700/month. I'm tired too, kid, but you're worth it.

I'm having a hard time because on Friday, one of my kiddos needed space. It's a testament to how hard they have worked to be able to say that. They were pulled from the home a year ago and are in the process of being legally adopted by the social worker who first responded to the case.

This kid was abused to the point of now a year later still struggling with seeping scarring and wounds that haven't finished healing. The staff and the student have a code word for when they need to go to the bathroom in the nurses office to just take their clothes off because the injuries itch so badly.

I run a lunch group and have a sensory room attached to my office. They asked for space, to eat lunch alone in the sensory room. Kids like this we don't leave unattended, even if it's just ensuring we have a visual on them. They were so withdrawn, deep in dissociation. I praised them and thanked them for asking for space and said that yes, it was okay for them to take alone time.

I snagged another para and asked for them to cover me in the lunch group. I came into the sensory room with a dog book and asked the student if it was ok for me to sit just outside the open door and read quietly. We have a lot of established trust at this point in the year and they said yes without hesitation.

After a few minutes, they started inching over, finally settling in next to me munching their lunch and looking at the book with me.

""That dog is really cute..."" they said
""Oh yeah totally! I think this one is my favorite.""
""Me too.""
""What's on the next page?""
""Let's look...""

We look at more pages for a while and it progresses into a laughing fit about a silly picture of a dog and their ball.

""Isn't this so cute, [student]??""
""Mmmmhm!""
""Yep.""

Then the silent tears started falling. We kept turning pages, but quietly now.

""Hey... I really miss my mom.""
""I know pal, I'm so sorry.""
""They did bad things to me. Really bad things.""

This student is five. Five years old and so kind, so smart, so *good*. They just miss their mom. Five.


We give everything to these kids, but they give everything back to us.

I'm having a hard time today, because there's no rationalizing it. This is one kid of so many I work with. I work 4 jobs and still sometimes worry about where my dinner will come from, but I make sure to bring enough extra food so a kiddo of mine has snacks during the day.

Our society is getting it wrong. So wrong. And today I'm having a really hard time with it.

I am having a really hard time today.I'm sorry this got so long.

I am an elementary special education paraeducator. I work with students whose situations run the gamut, all of whom have trouble being successful in gen ed classrooms. Our school has a 25% IEP rate - not including students on 504s or those who are needing to be or are currently being evaluated. My entire day is packed to the minute, and I've adjusted so that I have a 10 minute lunch because a new student came in and needs that time. The school district, which starts every successive year with deeper and deeper budget cuts, is saving a lot of money by having paras do this work.

It's worth it. They're worth it. I have a handful of students I worked with extensively at the beginning of the year who no longer need that time. Having them run up to me in the hall to tell me about a thing they did that day is everything.

People blame a lot of different factors for what they see as an epidemic of overdiagnosis - ADHD is caused by video games or autism is because of vaccines - and they miss it. 

Poverty and systemic oppression. Abuse and neglect. If a student comes to me in crisis the first thing I do is get eye level and do slow breathing until their lizard brain catches on and they mimic it and bring themselves back. The second thing I do is ask what they have eaten that day. 

The students who were born addicted to meth, with their small frames and heads and inability to regulate disappointment and anger. The homeless or tenuously housed kids who can't help but steal and hoard other students' resources. The kids who have to maintain the home because mom works three jobs who are too exhausted for circle time, let alone math. These are my kids.

I'm having a hard time today. I myself work four jobs, 80+ hours a week, with 7:30am-3pm in my para position. I work the other jobs because the district checks are only $700/month. I'm tired too, kid, but you're worth it.

I'm having a hard time because on Friday, one of my kiddos needed space. It's a testament to how hard they have worked to be able to say that. They were pulled from the home a year ago and are in the process of being legally adopted by the social worker who first responded to the case.

This kid was abused to the point of now a year later still struggling with seeping scarring and wounds that haven't finished healing. The staff and the student have a code word for when they need to go to the bathroom in the nurses office to just take their clothes off because the injuries itch so badly.

I run a lunch group and have a sensory room attached to my office. They asked for space, to eat lunch alone in the sensory room. Kids like this we don't leave unattended, even if it's just ensuring we have a visual on them. They were so withdrawn, deep in dissociation. I praised them and thanked them for asking for space and said that yes, it was okay for them to take alone time.

I snagged another para and asked for them to cover me in the lunch group. I came into the sensory room with a dog book and asked the student if it was ok for me to sit just outside the open door and read quietly. We have a lot of established trust at this point in the year and they said yes without hesitation.

After a few minutes, they started inching over, finally settling in next to me munching their lunch and looking at the book with me.

""That dog is really cute..."" they said
""Oh yeah totally! I think this one is my favorite.""
""Me too.""
""What's on the next page?""
""Let's look...""

We look at more pages for a while and it progresses into a laughing fit about a silly picture of a dog and their ball.

""Isn't this so cute, [student]??""
""Mmmmhm!""
""Yep.""

Then the silent tears started falling. We kept turning pages, but quietly now.

""Hey... I really miss my mom.""
""I know pal, I'm so sorry.""
""They did bad things to me. Really bad things.""
""Thank you for telling me, it's hard to do that.""
""Yeah...""
""If you ever want to talk, I'm here ok? Or if you ever want to just let some feels out with someone there, I'm here.""

Came in the middle of the year last year for my first year teaching. Taught at a low SES school. Had fun last year and came back. This year was a new admin team. More bureaucracy and paper work. Told me today on my conference that they would not renew my contract. Spent the conference period crying... So utterly humiliated and disappointed I won't be back. Technically I 'resigned' and they said they would go with whatever story I told the other district if I applied. Just hoping to make it through the day without my students noticing something is up. 

EDIT: Made it through the day. Finally back home. They told me I wasn't the right fit the school was looking toward as they moved forward. I could kind of see the writing on the wall. During walk throughs they provided feedback about my class room management. The second semester they had the Dean of students come to my class room a couple of times. The Dean said she say no issues in my class. At the meeting today, they did say I have improved. My reputation amongst the students was that I was funny and a bit goofy and well liked. I'm not angry or bitter toward admin. I know I was not what they wanted and I didn't change for them. I had one monster student who has been in 3 of my classes due to getting to kicked out by multiple different teachers. I did my best not to make any noise, didn't socialize much with other teachers, didn't send kids into the office and never complained. But I think they knew what type of personality I had and it wasn't what they wanted. I'll admit I wasn't a perfect teacher. As for the future... I probably will apply for teaching jobs and maybe take some time to consider if a career in education is for me. Right now my ego is hurt. I'm going to have to tell my family and friends.

HumiliatedHS chemistry teacher in Texas. Came in the middle of the year last year for my first year teaching. Taught at a low SES school. Had fun last year and came back. This year was a new admin team. More bureaucracy and paper work. Told me today on my conference that they would not renew my contract. Spent the conference period crying... So utterly humiliated and disappointed I won't be back. Technically I 'resigned' and they said they would go with whatever story I told the other district if I applied. Just hoping to make it through the day without my students noticing something is up. 

EDIT: Made it through the day. Finally back home. They told me I wasn't the right fit the school was looking toward as they moved forward. I could kind of see the writing on the wall. During walk throughs they provided feedback about my class room management. The second semester they had the Dean of students come to my class room a couple of times. The Dean said she say no issues in my class. At the meeting today, they did say I have improved. My reputation amongst the students was that I was funny and a bit goofy and well liked. I'm not angry or bitter toward admin. I know I was not what they wanted and I didn't change for them. I had one monster student who has been in 3 of my classes due to getting to kicked out by multiple different teachers. I did my best not to make any noise, didn't socialize much with other teachers, didn't send kids into the office and never complained. But I think they knew what type of personality I had and it wasn't what they wanted. I'll admit I wasn't a perfect teacher. As for the future... I probably will apply for teaching jobs and maybe take some time to consider if a career in education is for me. Right now my ego is hurt. I'm going to have to tell my family and friends.

I'm kind of more shooting from the hip, based on my experience in the ""real world"" before becoming a teacher, and talks with my wife, who works for the government, but in a job that is considered more a ""professional job"" than teaching is treated.

So, first off, let's face it:  Teaching isn't a job for humans.  Humans need internal and external motivators.  Humans need about 10,000 hours of doing something to be really good at it.  Humans don't even have a fully-developed pre-frontal cortex until age 25.  Humans have different abilities, skills, interests, and phases of life.

Teaching, as a career, ignores all of these.

Generally, as a teacher, you go to some sort of teaching program that has some tangential value to when you get into the classroom.  You'll learn about taxonomy, and psychology, and you'll probably have a misanthropic special ed professor whose connection to reality is hanging on by a hair.

But, then you'll do your student teaching, where you'll be paired with a master teacher (hopefully) that will gently ease you into the process, and explain to you that 90% of your teaching program was a waste of your time and money.  They'll teach you some real classroom management, and give you some great lessons.  Or, they'll suck, and you'll pay up the nose for it, regardless.  No one will be willing to acknowledge that some people are good at training teachers, and some are not, and the system is generally be haphazard.

Then, after subbing (or not) for a while, where you're treated like garbage most of the time, and you'll be forced to jump between dozens of classroom management styles, you'll get your first teaching job.  Where you will teach full time, with basically no real teaching experience, in one of the most difficult schools, for very, very low pay.

I'm going to be honest, here:  What we do to new teachers isn't just bad, or wrong, it is bordering on inhuman and evil.  It isn't just wrong to do to the teachers, it's wrong to do to the students.  We are taking people (students and young teachers) when they're the most vulnerable, and putting them in the worst possible situations.  And, then, we're paying them so little that they would probably be better off waiting tables or delivering pizzas.

Quite often in these new teacher school environments, they are given little to no support, and almost everyone else there is in the exact same situation.  They are there to try to move on to a better job, surrounded by inexperienced or ineffective admin and other teachers, who are just getting their feet wet, or aren't able to get better jobs.

Most teachers don't actually make it out of this initial phase.  Most quite before finishing student teaching, subbing, or their first few years.  AND WE ACT LIKE THIS IS A GOOD THING!  We say that they just weren't cut out for it.  We find fault in them.  And yet, we (as a nation and an educational system) have set them up to fail.  We have done the equivalent of throwing a kid just out of boot camp into an F-15 in the middle of a dog fight in the first day.  And we blame them for failing.

So, if you survive to mid-career, you might be hoping to have children, or save up for a house.  But now you need to get a Masters degree, or a National Boards certification.  You're also expected to start to take some leadership because so many new ones are gone, and the old teachers are burned out, pissed off, and have been through that ringer a dozen times before.  And they're right.  It's a constant cycle of B.S. being sold, sometimes with new names, but it's all the same.

So, in mid-career, you're forced to make a decision, do you become a ""selfish teacher"" that focuses on family, do you go into administration and forsake teaching, or do you fall for the B.S. and become a stooge of the district, willing to go with whatever the current admin is going to come up with this week.

By the late career, the kids might be older, and perhaps are on to college.  But at this point, most are jaded and nihilistic towards education.  Perhaps now you're a department head if you've been willing to tow the party line.  Maybe you beat the buses out of the parking lot.  You've got most of your lesson plans memorized, and you make little tweaks as needed.

All the while, in the teaching pay scale, your biggest motivator is to just survive.  Literally.  The biggest effect you can have on your pay is generally to not die.  A new degree might help a little, but if you look at the biggest effect, it's time.

So, bitching is easy.  My first period students have it down to an art form.  I had a student complain that because of all their extra credit, their grade couldn't go up any more.  Such is life.

What is the solution?

Make teaching a job that people actually want to go into, want to stay in, want to get better at, and want to compete for.

Here's how I think you do it:

1. Teacher training should be done by people who are actually experts at training teachers in the classroom.  This is a very distinct skill that is different from being a good teacher.  And it is NOTHING like being a professor.  Professors know a LOT about a little.  Teachers have to know a little about a LOT, and they have to be able to make 1000 decisions in a second, most of them without a full amount of information.  Teaching this is a skill on its own, and we need to cultivate and value it.

2. A new teacher should have have a greater or more difficult work load than an experienced or mid-career teacher.  That's f-ing stupid, and everyone knows this.  Currently, regardless how experienced you are, you are paid to work about 5 hours in front of a class, and about 2.5 hours of prep/grading/lunch.  A new teacher needs more time to prepare, and more time to grade.  This has to change.  There is no way a new teacher should be expected to take a full course load immediately, especially not in their first couple years.  There should be a phase-in time (explained later) that represents your skills and knowledge.

3. Some teachers are good at some things, other teachers are good at other things, and we need to acknowledge that. We all know the quote: “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Okay, first off, Einstein almost certainly didn't say that, but whatever, it's a good quote.  Just because it's a good quote doesn't mean you need to attribute it to someone smart.  It probably came from an old book in the 1800s, but that is besides the point  We evaluate teachers based on what their students learned sometimes, or sometimes we evaluate teachers on their willingness to kiss admin's ass.  But we don't evaluate them on what they're actually doing most of the time.  We have teachers who are good at developing cool curriculum.  We have teachers that are good at running difficult classrooms.  We have teachers that are good a leading departments.  Hell, in my school we have a teacher who is a bloody genius at schedules.  We all have our things, and we don't value those, especially not formally.

4.  Some teachers should be allowed to just be good teachers, and left alone.  This isn't Lake Wobegon.  I had a fellow educator argue that ""Shouldn't all teachers be great?""  No.  That's not possible.  At every job there are people who are below-average.  There are some that are struggling, and need time to improve.  There are some that just want to have a stable job.  And in nearly no other job would we attack them for it.

So, here is how I envision teaching in a nearly-ideal situation:

There will be different types of teachers, based on their skills and interests.  They will be placed into situations that allow them to succeed and flourish.  There will be a real and sustainable system for training, developing, and maturing teachers.

When you start out, you will get a Professional Teacher Trainer.  They will be a classroom teacher, but also will be someone who is good at and enjoys training future teachers.  They will be good at integrating a learning teacher into their classroom.  They will become experts at this specific job.  They will have fewer expectations for classroom instruction time, since part of their instruction will not just be their students, but also their teachers-in-training.  During this time you are an employee of the district, not a student.  The pay would be more similar to an intern, but that’s really what they are.  They would begin the job of being a teacher, and slowly they would take over more classroom duties, and the Teacher Trainer would be working to make them better as they observed their classroom.

In your first 2-4 years, you would be a Teacher 1.  These positions would teach about 60-75% of what full-time teachers teach.  They would also be aided by Teacher Trainers, more as an advisory role.  Teacher 1s would advance as their teaching improved and this would be decided by administration and advised by the Teacher Trainers.  If a Teacher 1 was able to show that they were performing well enough, they could have an external evaluator come and determine whether or not they were good enough to advance.

As a Teacher 2, you would earn more than a Teacher 1, but also have greater expectations.  You would have a “full” class load, but would not be expected to deal with overcrowded classrooms, or the most difficult students or work environments.  You would have the expectations of a normal teacher, and if you were not able to perform these expectations, you may be demoted to a Teacher 1, so that you can improve again.  Some teachers may actually choose to go back down to a Teacher 1, if their life calls for it.

As a Teacher 3, you are now a master teacher.  You can deal with the most difficult classes, or handle classes that are at maximum capacity.  You are great at what you do, and you are paid for it.  You are the epitome of a great classroom teacher.  And that’s what you are.  You do not have pseudo-administrative duties shoved on to you.  You are just allowed to teach and be great at it.

But you can also choose to diversify, and explore other options.

You could choose to be a professional Teacher Trainer.  You would take classes on how to train teachers, and how to integrate teachers.  Your teaching workload would be reduced, but you would have other expectations.

You could choose to become a Curriculum Specialized teacher, where you have a lower class load, but are expected to generate curriculum for other teachers in the district, or in the area.  You would lead trainings, but would still be in the classroom.  WAY TOO OFTEN former teachers are developing curriculums while no longer in the classroom.  They might be admin, or some other district office employee, but they’re now disconnected from what is actually going on, and it shows.  This has to stop as well.

You could become a Department Administrator, where your teaching time is reduced, but you are expected to take the load off of other teachers, and also work in a position where they are doing some of the work that administration is currently bogged down with.  This would also keep administration decisions informed by classroom teachers.  You would also be a better evaluator of teachers than administration, as you would have direct knowledge of how to teach in that field.

And if a teacher chose to step away from one responsibility, they could go to a Teacher 3, or even a 2, if they wanted to reduce their teaching load for personal reasons.

This is not a perfect system, but no system is.  There might be some disagreement on who should be able to do what, but let’s be honest, that’s how real work… works.  That’s why unions and management work together.  But this is a hell of a lot better than what we do now.

The classes I teach are for students below grade level in reading, so they need a LOT of help. 

There seems to be a huge increase this year in adults who ask me to “give students some work” as though that’s my primary job - a person who hands out some magical “work” that students can do. 

This happens a lot with students who miss a lot of class or don’t do any of the assignments they received originally. 

I have one student who rarely comes to school before lunch. I have him 1st period, so he’s never here. My class is not only a class he needs to pass in order to move to 10th grade, but it also has a state test worth 20% of his grade that he will not pass without a lot of learning and practice. 

I brought up my concerns that he has missed SO MUCH of my class and I don’t see how he’s going to make up the instruction he needs. Rather than put him on homebound or even move his English 1 to the afternoon, the school psychologist and his guidance counselor said “let his dad know when he misses pertinent instruction,” as though this doesn’t happen every day.

For the many kids who miss school (even though they live in walking distance and on a bus route) or who never do anything in class, I am frequently asked to “give them work” to help them bring their grades up, as if there are magical packets that will teach them things, rather than just be busy work. 

I find it difficult to articulate my frustrations, but I am so fed up with adults in education at my school expecting me to “give them work” to make up for lost learning. Completing packets does not equal learning!

And the constant, mistaken assumption that every day is not an important day of learning in my class is so frustrating. Like my job is not to educate. Like I sit at my desk and hand out work and then take it back up all day long. Like I’m not working my butt off every day interacting with my kids and actually teaching. 

It doesn’t help that my API is like this too. She seems to truly believe that substitutes can do the same job we do, because I think she thinks that teaching is mostly handing work out to kids.

Yesterday a student in my 8th grade class started feeling sick and dizzy right towards the end of class, so I told her friend to walk her down to the nurse. Another girl, M, who is one of the rudest and most disrespectful humans I’ve ever met, decided that she would use my classroom phone without my permission to call the sick girl’s mother. So as students are leaving class and packing up, I see M on the phone. I walked over to her and asked who she was talking to, and told her to get off the phone because she didn’t have permission to use it. She says “stop talking to me” and continues on the phone. I didn’t want to snatch the phone out of her hand, so I waited. When she hung up with the girl’s mother, I reprimanded her for the incident and her comment to me. I was planning to write up the incident as a detention later that day. 

So after M goes back to homeroom she asked the homeroom teacher if she could check on her friend at the nurse. She goes down to the nurse, throws her friend’s stuff on the ground and says “I called your mom, she might come to get you.” The nurse asked her something and M looked at her and goes “Ugh. Nobody wants *your* opinion you old bitch.* The nurse was so offended that she went straight to the office and reported the disrespect.

Later, the principal gets wind of what’s going on and asked me if M used my phone earlier and whether she had permission. I said she didn’t have permission and I explained the situation. Principal says not to write the detention because she would take care of it herself. So the principal questions M, who lies and denies everything, but the principal knows she’s full of shit. M finally admits that she used the phone but claims she had permission, and claims the nurse called her a bitch first. Principal just writes a detention and calls the girl’s mother. 

The mother always takes her daughter’s side, and when the principal explained what happened, she started screaming, claiming “this school is prejudiced against my daughter because she’s black (btw our school is about 85% black), the teachers always pick on her for no reason, my daughter had the right to call whoever she wants whenever she wants and if you don’t let her than I’ll sue you for infringing on her right to free speech!” She also insisted that she would not allow her daughter to serve the detention because it was unfairly given and we were “making up lies” about her daughter. 

The principal told me all of this today, and both of us were just in disbelief at the whole thing. I’m not sure what else will happen after this, but the whole thing is just crazy. 

I truly adore 99% of my students but this girl is really a struggle.

The mother always takes her daughter’s side, and when the principal explained what happened, she started screaming, claiming “this school is prejudiced against my daughter because she’s black (btw our school is about 85% black), the teachers always pick on her for no reason, my daughter had the right to call whoever she wants whenever she wants and if you don’t let her than I’ll sue you for infringing on her right to free speech!” She also insisted that she would not allow her daughter to serve the detention because it was unfairly given and we were “making up lies” about her daughter. 

The principal told me all of this today, and both of us were just in disbelief at the whole thing. I’m not sure what else will happen after this, but the whole thing is just crazy. 

I truly adore 99% of my students but this girl is really a struggle.

TL;DR a student used my class phone without permission, insisted the school nurse, and lied about everything. When she was given a detention the mother claimed we were racist and taking away her right to free speech.",279,compound,-0.9897,2018

I was skeptical given his history of work avoidance, but he seemed to genuinely want to do this, and wanted to make sure that everyone got their cards today. I took him up on the deal and he made six of the sweetest cards I've ever seen, including an apology card for his math teacher, where he has the most trouble.

It's an interesting field, especially as you get deeper into it, and you start to realize that you can design a research project to find nearly any result that you want, if you're willing to be unscrupulous about it.

For example, a certain agricultural manufacturer wanted to show that their product had no effect on animals living in the soil.  So, what they did was spray a very small amount of product on three earthworms, and didn't spray that small amount on three others.  Then, after a very short period of time, they showed that the product had no effect at all on the worms.  The worms actually shrunk by 33% on average, but because the variability of worm size is so great, the effect was not significant.  They then came the the conclusion that their product had zero effect on the entire ecosystem, due to this single experiment on a single species.  The study was irrefutable, as it is absolutely 100% a scientifically correct study.  There was replication, and the effect was not significant.  And those without science degrees or knowledge of how the experiment was designed could herald it as a scientific study that showed exactly what they wanted to see.

As I arrived into the education world, I was still in the mindset of someone who studied experimental design.  I started looking at some of the case studies, and the research that was coming out of the education field.  It was abysmal.  The design didn't match the conclusions.  There was an intent to create effects where there wasn't by reducing the population to small numbers, and selecting specific data sets after analysis.

So what I want to talk about first is how to design research so that the the results look significant when they're not.

1) Design the test to fit the results you want.

This is the most common method used.  You can actually see it with nearly every curriculum, as they very closely control who gets to see the actual test questions.  Normal, and valid, testing methods use a huge test bank of questions, and choose randomly from those questions.  You'll see test bank sizes of upwards of thousands of questions for a well-designed experiment.  This allows the researcher to see the effects of not just the independent variables, but also to tease out unintended effects of question order, test size, etc.

However, for a lot of the new tests, you won't see many, or even ANY of the test questions.  They might give a very limited set of release questions.  They will say that they want to keep them secret.  Any time you hear or see this, know that this *automatically* makes the test flawed.  This means that the test question bank is so small as to allow the variability of questions themselves to alter the results significantly.  For instance, the most statistically valid test in the United States is the SAT.  They release hundreds, if not thousands, of test questions per year.  They know the independent effect of individual questions, the effect of length, the effect of order.  Often testing companies will say that they only have a certain number of questions written, or that they cannot reveal the specific test format.  This is unequivocal bullshit.  Statewide tests are funded to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per year.  You don't think they have enough time or money to do a full set of test questions?  In fact, they DO have a huge set of test questions.  But by limiting the test questions that align with the results wanted, they can predict results before testing has even begun.  Often they will know what questions students will do poorly on based on preliminary tests with specific districts.  (Hey, my district just got an offer to give the test to our students a year ahead!  What luck!)

Are you looking to sell a curriculum in the future?  Then put on questions that you know students will do poorly in.  Don't release any practice questions even SLIGHTLY similar to those that the students will see on the test.

Now, after the students have used the curriculum, NOW they will see questions that are nearly identical to the questions in the curriculum.  Questions will be phrased in the same way.  The words will be identical, or similar.  The conclusions will have equivalents in the problems already solved.

And this is why we're told to not discuss or look at the questions.  The tests are designed to match the curriculum, rather than match the needed knowledge.

2) Control the testing environment to produce the results you want.

This is a classic in a lot of biological studies.  If you allow me to control the environment, I can give you any result you could even conceive.  Let me control the environment, and I will be able to show that elephants have a positive effect on polar bears.

Have you noticed how an increasingly large numbers of these tests appear on computers?  That's not a coincidence.  It's not for ease of grading, or anything like that.  That's to help control the data.  By putting tests on computers, you can create confusion for the test-takers.  Hell, you can even boost test results by allowing students onto computers, as well.  You don't think that a student can figure a way around testing procedures?

You want good results?  Use the same interface that students have used for your curriculum?  You want bad results?  Use a confusing interface, that slows students down.  You want REALLY good results?  Allow students to find ways to access the internet, even as you say that it's not possible.

3) Have as many sub-groups as you can devise, and then see what sticks.

""Our curriculum increased the reading level of Title I students by XXX percent!""

First off, no it didn't.  See parts 1 and 2.  Second, you are using that specific group because that's where you saw an effect that looks big.  One time I saw a result that said their curriculum increased the results for minority, free and reduced lunch, female students by some number.  This is a classic multiple qualifier that you should immediately recognize as garbage.  The more specific the qualifier, the less valid the data, and the more cherry-picked the number is.

I had a biostatistics professor who used to call this the ""Shotgun method"".  Basically, you fired at random at a data set, and saw what fell out.  Then you did the analysis afterwards, and came up with conclusions.  This is called ""post-hoc"" analysis, and it generally is absolute garbage.

4) Ignore variability.

This is a classic.  I have attended dozens of talks on educational data, and they are almost never presented by the actual statisticians.  Most statisticians won't get within 100 miles of the conclusions that are being made, so hand it off to a district office employee, a government employee, or a corporate salesperson.  The first question you should ask when watching these presentations is simply, ""What is your measure of variability for this study?""  Not once have I gotten an answer.  I've probably asked this question 40 times.  My favorite answer was ""Well, there are a lot of psychostatisticians working on this...""

The reason variability is important is because it puts the actual results in perspective.  For instance, I once bowled a 175.  Prior to that, I'd never broken 120.  I hardly ever break 100.  I'm a terrible bowler.  But if I tell you that I've bowled a 175, you might think I'm okay.  And that would be misguided.

The variability of most educational studies is massive.  Most of the data is actually random noise, as a result of the individual students, the day and time it was given, the method of giving the test, and the weather for the day.  The effect of the curriculum, the teacher, or the school is so small as to be eaten alive by all the variability.

One of the most terrifying statistics I saw presented was an attempt to compare schools by finding similar students at the schools, based on just one test score.  Basically, if a student had scored similarly to another student, they would be paired together, and then if one went up more than the other, it was said that the one that went up more had a better teacher/curriculum/school/district.  This didn't just ignore the effect of variability, it compounded it.  And this was the best data set that the entire state was willing to produce.  Again, not a single statistician in the room that was able to discuss the limitations of the data set.  Just a single district office employee.  But it was okay, because that data was good for us.

5)  Lie.  

Just make up data.  Fudge it.  Drop ""outliers"".  Refuse to allow others to see your complete data set.  Most of these proprietary data sets are held in secret because they need to be massaged.  Let's say you're comparing students that didn't use your curriculum versus those who did, but you've got a student in the non-curriculum-using population that is an absolute whiz.  A curve-wrecker.  Or even worse, a teacher who teaches better than your curriculum is able to teach to the test.  What do you do?  Well, they're called ""outliers"", and you drop them right away.  Dropping outliers is an important part of making data fit what you want.  It's absolutely against the rules, but it's like holding in the NFL.  It's happening all the time, the key is you don't get caught.  And if you've got a proprietary data set, you're not going to get caught, because the data is yours, and they can only see your results.

-------------------

And this gets to why whenever your school buys a new curriculum, you will nearly never get the results that they say they got.  They've designed their tests to match their curriculum.  They've adapted the environment to match what they want.  They've created sub-groups and presented the highest-performing one as the norm.  They've ignored all measures of variability.

As I arrived into the education world, I was still in the mindset of someone who studied experimental design.  I started looking at some of the case studies, and the research that was coming out of the education field.  It was abysmal.  The design didn't match the conclusions.  There was an intent to create effects where there wasn't by reducing the population to small numbers, and selecting specific data sets after analysis.

So what I want to talk about first is how to design research so that the the results look significant when they're not.

1) Design the test to fit the results you want.

This is the most common method used.  You can actually see it with nearly every curriculum, as they very closely control who gets to see the actual test questions.  Normal, and valid, testing methods use a huge test bank of questions, and choose randomly from those questions.  You'll see test bank sizes of upwards of thousands of questions for a well-designed experiment.  This allows the researcher to see the effects of not just the independent variables, but also to tease out unintended effects of question order, test size, etc.

However, for a lot of the new tests, you won't see many, or even ANY of the test questions.  They might give a very limited set of release questions.  They will say that they want to keep them secret.  Any time you hear or see this, know that this *automatically* makes the test flawed.  This means that the test question bank is so small as to allow the variability of questions themselves to alter the results significantly.  For instance, the most statistically valid test in the United States is the SAT.  They release hundreds, if not thousands, of test questions per year.  They know the independent effect of individual questions, the effect of length, the effect of order.  Often testing companies will say that they only have a certain number of questions written, or that they cannot reveal the specific test format.  This is unequivocal bullshit.  Statewide tests are funded to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per year.  You don't think they have enough time or money to do a full set of test questions?  In fact, they DO have a huge set of test questions.  But by limiting the test questions that align with the results wanted, they can predict results before testing has even begun.  Often they will know what questions students will do poorly on based on preliminary tests with specific districts.  (Hey, my district just got an offer to give the test to our students a year ahead!  What luck!)

Are you looking to sell a curriculum in the future?  Then put on questions that you know students will do poorly in.  Don't release any practice questions even SLIGHTLY similar to those that the students will see on the test.

Now, after the students have used the curriculum, NOW they will see questions that are nearly identical to the questions in the curriculum.  Questions will be phrased in the same way.  The words will be identical, or similar.  The conclusions will have equivalents in the problems already solved.

And this is why we're told to not discuss or look at the questions.  The tests are designed to match the curriculum, rather than match the needed knowledge.

2) Control the testing environment to produce the results you want.

This is a classic in a lot of biological studies.  If you allow me to control the environment, I can give you any result you could even conceive.  Let me control the environment, and I will be able to show that elephants have a positive effect on polar bears.

Have you noticed how an increasingly large numbers of these tests appear on computers?  That's not a coincidence.  It's not for ease of grading, or anything like that.  That's to help control the data.  By putting tests on computers, you can create confusion for the test-takers.  Hell, you can even boost test results by allowing students onto computers, as well.  You don't think that a student can figure a way around testing procedures?

You want good results?  Use the same interface that students have used for your curriculum?  You want bad results?  Use a confusing interface, that slows students down.  You want REALLY good results?  Allow students to find ways to access the internet, even as you say that it's not possible.

3) Have as many sub-groups as you can devise, and then see what sticks.

""Our curriculum increased the reading level of Title I students by XXX percent!""

First off, no it didn't.  See parts 1 and 2.  Second, you are using that specific group because that's where you saw an effect that looks big.  One time I saw a result that said their curriculum increased the results for minority, free and reduced lunch, female students by some number.  This is a classic multiple qualifier that you should immediately recognize as garbage.  The more specific the qualifier, the less valid the data, and the more cherry-picked the number is.

I had a biostatistics professor who used to call this the ""Shotgun method"".  Basically, you fired at random at a data set, and saw what fell out.  Then you did the analysis afterwards, and came up with conclusions.  This is called ""post-hoc"" analysis, and it generally is absolute garbage.

4) Ignore variability.

This is a classic.  I have attended dozens of talks on educational data, and they are almost never presented by the actual statisticians.  Most statisticians won't get within 100 miles of the conclusions that are being made, so hand it off to a district office employee, a government employee, or a corporate salesperson.  The first question you should ask when watching these presentations is simply, ""What is your measure of variability for this study?""  Not once have I gotten an answer.  I've probably asked this question 40 times.  My favorite answer was ""Well, there are a lot of psychostatisticians working on this...""

The reason variability is important is because it puts the actual results in perspective.  For instance, I once bowled a 175.  Prior to that, I'd never broken 120.  I hardly ever break 100.  I'm a terrible bowler.  But if I tell you that I've bowled a 175, you might think I'm okay.  And that would be misguided.

The variability of most educational studies is massive.  Most of the data is actually random noise, as a result of the individual students, the day and time it was given, the method of giving the test, and the weather for the day.  The effect of the curriculum, the teacher, or the school is so small as to be eaten alive by all the variability.

One of the most terrifying statistics I saw presented was an attempt to compare schools by finding similar students at the schools, based on just one test score.  Basically, if a student had scored similarly to another student, they would be paired together, and then if one went up more than the other, it was said that the one that went up more had a better teacher/curriculum/school/district.  This didn't just ignore the effect of variability, it compounded it.  And this was the best data set that the entire state was willing to produce.  Again, not a single statistician in the room that was able to discuss the limitations of the data set.  Just a single district office employee.  But it was okay, because that data was good for us.

5)  Lie.  

Just make up data.  Fudge it.  Drop ""outliers"".  Refuse to allow others to see your complete data set.  Most of these proprietary data sets are held in secret because they need to be massaged.  Let's say you're comparing students that didn't use your curriculum versus those who did, but you've got a student in the non-curriculum-using population that is an absolute whiz.  A curve-wrecker.  Or even worse, a teacher who teaches better than your curriculum is able to teach to the test.  What do you do?  Well, they're called ""outliers"", and you drop them right away.  Dropping outliers is an important part of making data fit what you want.  It's absolutely against the rules, but it's like holding in the NFL.  It's happening all the time, the key is you don't get caught.  And if you've got a proprietary data set, you're not going to get caught, because the data is yours, and they can only see your results.

-------------------

And this gets to why whenever your school buys a new curriculum, you will nearly never get the results that they say they got.  They've designed their tests to match their curriculum.  They've adapted the environment to match what they want.  They've created sub-groups and presented the highest-performing one as the norm.  They've ignored all measures of variability.  And they've flat-out lied.",297,compound,0.9978,2018

Now I won’t lie there are admin changes, an overcrowded school, disciplinary issues, however, it was more than that I felt like I was burning out faster than ever.

This past week our county did a “teach to contract” meaning only work from 7:15am to 2:45pm. No after school grading, no planning, no coming in early to help students. At first I was a little annoyed, how would I get things done?! Then the week happened and I heard everyone else involved saying the same thing. We were burning out. But I learned more than that.

My students care more than my educational board. They understood I didn’t have time to grade and they weren’t upset or bothered. They saw me rushing in my classroom as the bell rung and some ran to hold my door open for other students and would say “miss go set up! We’ve got the door and the projector on for you!”. My students even started ushering each other out at 2:35pm saying “she needs to go home stop stressing her out.” My admin didn’t melt down or scream at me for not working harder (that one is a weird fear I have). No parents got upset that grades weren’t going in as fast. I slept in and still made it early enough to beat the student carpool rush. I left earlier and had time to care for my home life and myself. 

I didn’t get a lot of planning or grading done, but my stress my anxiety and my fears have decreased so much I started to think “why did I let myself do those things?” I know the answer is my students. I do it for them. The thing is they wanted me to keep doing this to an extent.

I am an elementary special education paraeducator. I work with students whose situations run the gamut, all of whom have trouble being successful in gen ed classrooms. Our school has a 25% IEP rate - not including students on 504s or those who are needing to be or are currently being evaluated. My entire day is packed to the minute, and I've adjusted so that I have a 10 minute lunch because a new student came in and needs that time. The school district, which starts every successive year with deeper and deeper budget cuts, is saving a lot of money by having paras do this work.

It's worth it. They're worth it. I have a handful of students I worked with extensively at the beginning of the year who no longer need that time. Having them run up to me in the hall to tell me about a thing they did that day is everything.

People blame a lot of different factors for what they see as an epidemic of overdiagnosis - ADHD is caused by video games or autism is because of vaccines - and they miss it. 

Poverty and systemic oppression. Abuse and neglect. If a student comes to me in crisis the first thing I do is get eye level and do slow breathing until their lizard brain catches on and they mimic it and bring themselves back. The second thing I do is ask what they have eaten that day. 

The students who were born addicted to meth, with their small frames and heads and inability to regulate disappointment and anger. The homeless or tenuously housed kids who can't help but steal and hoard other students' resources. The kids who have to maintain the home because mom works three jobs who are too exhausted for circle time, let alone math. These are my kids.

I'm having a hard time today. I myself work four jobs, 80+ hours a week, with 7:30am-3pm in my para position. I work the other jobs because the district checks are only $700/month. I'm tired too, kid, but you're worth it.

I'm having a hard time because on Friday, one of my kiddos needed space. It's a testament to how hard they have worked to be able to say that. They were pulled from the home a year ago and are in the process of being legally adopted by the social worker who first responded to the case.

This kid was abused to the point of now a year later still struggling with seeping scarring and wounds that haven't finished healing. The staff and the student have a code word for when they need to go to the bathroom in the nurses office to just take their clothes off because the injuries itch so badly.

I run a lunch group and have a sensory room attached to my office. They asked for space, to eat lunch alone in the sensory room. Kids like this we don't leave unattended, even if it's just ensuring we have a visual on them. They were so withdrawn, deep in dissociation. I praised them and thanked them for asking for space and said that yes, it was okay for them to take alone time.

I snagged another para and asked for them to cover me in the lunch group. I came into the sensory room with a dog book and asked the student if it was ok for me to sit just outside the open door and read quietly. We have a lot of established trust at this point in the year and they said yes without hesitation.

After a few minutes, they started inching over, finally settling in next to me munching their lunch and looking at the book with me.

""That dog is really cute..."" they said
""Oh yeah totally! I think this one is my favorite.""
""Me too.""
""What's on the next page?""
""Let's look...""

We look at more pages for a while and it progresses into a laughing fit about a silly picture of a dog and their ball.

""Isn't this so cute, [student]??""
""Mmmmhm!""
""Yep.""

Then the silent tears started falling. We kept turning pages, but quietly now.

""Hey... I really miss my mom.""
""I know pal, I'm so sorry.""
""They did bad things to me. Really bad things.""
""Thank you for telling me, it's hard to do that.""
""Yeah...""
""If you ever want to talk, I'm here ok? Or if you ever want to just let some feels out with someone there, I'm here.""
""I know. HEY ohhhh that puppy is so cute!!""

This student is five. Five years old and so kind, so smart, so *good*. They just miss their mom. Five.


We give everything to these kids, but they give everything back to us.

I'm having a hard time today, because there's no rationalizing it. This is one kid of so many I work with. I work 4 jobs and still sometimes worry about where my dinner will come from, but I make sure to bring enough extra food so a kiddo of mine has snacks during the day.

Our society is getting it wrong. So wrong. And today I'm having a really hard time with it.

Edit: I'm getting a lot of thank yous and while it feels good, I want to be clear that I didn't post this for self aggrandizement or praise - I just want to bring the issue of poverty and systemic oppression in students to light. We are all of us in this together, thank ALL of you for the work you do. ",True,False,False,Teachers,t5_2qqcs,,public,self,I am an elementary special education para in a school with a 25% IEP rate.

Poverty and systemic oppression. Abuse and neglect. If a student comes to me in crisis the first thing I do is get eye level and do slow breathing until their lizard brain catches on and they mimic it and bring themselves back. The second thing I do is ask what they have eaten that day. 

The students who were born addicted to meth, with their small frames and heads and inability to regulate disappointment and anger. The homeless or tenuously housed kids who can't help but steal and hoard other students' resources. The kids who have to maintain the home because mom works three jobs who are too exhausted for circle time, let alone math. These are my kids.

I'm having a hard time today. I myself work four jobs, 80+ hours a week, with 7:30am-3pm in my para position. I work the other jobs because the district checks are only $700/month. I'm tired too, kid, but you're worth it.

I'm having a hard time because on Friday, one of my kiddos needed space. It's a testament to how hard they have worked to be able to say that. They were pulled from the home a year ago and are in the process of being legally adopted by the social worker who first responded to the case.

This kid was abused to the point of now a year later still struggling with seeping scarring and wounds that haven't finished healing. The staff and the student have a code word for when they need to go to the bathroom in the nurses office to just take their clothes off because the injuries itch so badly.

I run a lunch group and have a sensory room attached to my office. They asked for space, to eat lunch alone in the sensory room. Kids like this we don't leave unattended, even if it's just ensuring we have a visual on them. They were so withdrawn, deep in dissociation. I praised them and thanked them for asking for space and said that yes, it was okay for them to take alone time.

I snagged another para and asked for them to cover me in the lunch group. I came into the sensory room with a dog book and asked the student if it was ok for me to sit just outside the open door and read quietly. We have a lot of established trust at this point in the year and they said yes without hesitation.

After a few minutes, they started inching over, finally settling in next to me munching their lunch and looking at the book with me.

""That dog is really cute..."" they said
""Oh yeah totally! I think this one is my favorite.""
""Me too.""
""What's on the next page?""
""Let's look...""

We look at more pages for a while and it progresses into a laughing fit about a silly picture of a dog and their ball.

""Isn't this so cute, [student]??""
""Mmmmhm!""
""Yep.""

Then the silent tears started falling. We kept turning pages, but quietly now.

""Hey... I really miss my mom.""
""I know pal, I'm so sorry.""
""They did bad things to me. Really bad things.""
""Thank you for telling me, it's hard to do that.""
""Yeah...""
""If you ever want to talk, I'm here ok? Or if you ever want to just let some feels out with someone there, I'm here.""
""I know. HEY ohhhh that puppy is so cute!!""

This student is five. Five years old and so kind, so smart, so *good*. They just miss their mom. Five.


We give everything to these kids, but they give everything back to us.

I'm having a hard time today, because there's no rationalizing it. This is one kid of so many I work with. I work 4 jobs and still sometimes worry about where my dinner will come from, but I make sure to bring enough extra food so a kiddo of mine has snacks during the day.

Our society is getting it wrong. So wrong. And today I'm having a really hard time with it.

Edit: I'm getting a lot of thank yous and while it feels good, I want to be clear that I didn't post this for self aggrandizement or praise - I just want to bring the issue of poverty and systemic oppression in students to light. We are all of us in this together, thank ALL of you for the work you do. ",320,compound,0.9876,2018

I'm kind of more shooting from the hip, based on my experience in the ""real world"" before becoming a teacher, and talks with my wife, who works for the government, but in a job that is considered more a ""professional job"" than teaching is treated.

So, first off, let's face it:  Teaching isn't a job for humans.  Humans need internal and external motivators.  Humans need about 10,000 hours of doing something to be really good at it.  Humans don't even have a fully-developed pre-frontal cortex until age 25.  Humans have different abilities, skills, interests, and phases of life.

Teaching, as a career, ignores all of these.

Generally, as a teacher, you go to some sort of teaching program that has some tangential value to when you get into the classroom.  You'll learn about taxonomy, and psychology, and you'll probably have a misanthropic special ed professor whose connection to reality is hanging on by a hair.

But, then you'll do your student teaching, where you'll be paired with a master teacher (hopefully) that will gently ease you into the process, and explain to you that 90% of your teaching program was a waste of your time and money.  They'll teach you some real classroom management, and give you some great lessons.  Or, they'll suck, and you'll pay up the nose for it, regardless.  No one will be willing to acknowledge that some people are good at training teachers, and some are not, and the system is generally be haphazard.

Then, after subbing (or not) for a while, where you're treated like garbage most of the time, and you'll be forced to jump between dozens of classroom management styles, you'll get your first teaching job.  Where you will teach full time, with basically no real teaching experience, in one of the most difficult schools, for very, very low pay.

I'm going to be honest, here:  What we do to new teachers isn't just bad, or wrong, it is bordering on inhuman and evil.  It isn't just wrong to do to the teachers, it's wrong to do to the students.  We are taking people (students and young teachers) when they're the most vulnerable, and putting them in the worst possible situations.  And, then, we're paying them so little that they would probably be better off waiting tables or delivering pizzas.

Quite often in these new teacher school environments, they are given little to no support, and almost everyone else there is in the exact same situation.  They are there to try to move on to a better job, surrounded by inexperienced or ineffective admin and other teachers, who are just getting their feet wet, or aren't able to get better jobs.

Most teachers don't actually make it out of this initial phase.  Most quite before finishing student teaching, subbing, or their first few years.  AND WE ACT LIKE THIS IS A GOOD THING!  We say that they just weren't cut out for it.  We find fault in them.  And yet, we (as a nation and an educational system) have set them up to fail.  We have done the equivalent of throwing a kid just out of boot camp into an F-15 in the middle of a dog fight in the first day.  And we blame them for failing.

So, if you survive to mid-career, you might be hoping to have children, or save up for a house.  But now you need to get a Masters degree, or a National Boards certification.  You're also expected to start to take some leadership because so many new ones are gone, and the old teachers are burned out, pissed off, and have been through that ringer a dozen times before.  And they're right.  It's a constant cycle of B.S. being sold, sometimes with new names, but it's all the same.

So, in mid-career, you're forced to make a decision, do you become a ""selfish teacher"" that focuses on family, do you go into administration and forsake teaching, or do you fall for the B.S. and become a stooge of the district, willing to go with whatever the current admin is going to come up with this week.

By the late career, the kids might be older, and perhaps are on to college.  But at this point, most are jaded and nihilistic towards education.  Perhaps now you're a department head if you've been willing to tow the party line.  Maybe you beat the buses out of the parking lot.  You've got most of your lesson plans memorized, and you make little tweaks as needed.

All the while, in the teaching pay scale, your biggest motivator is to just survive.  Literally.  The biggest effect you can have on your pay is generally to not die.  A new degree might help a little, but if you look at the biggest effect, it's time.

So, bitching is easy.  My first period students have it down to an art form.  I had a student complain that because of all their extra credit, their grade couldn't go up any more.  Such is life.

What is the solution?

Make teaching a job that people actually want to go into, want to stay in, want to get better at, and want to compete for.

Here's how I think you do it:

1. Teacher training should be done by people who are actually experts at training teachers in the classroom.  This is a very distinct skill that is different from being a good teacher.  And it is NOTHING like being a professor.  Professors know a LOT about a little.  Teachers have to know a little about a LOT, and they have to be able to make 1000 decisions in a second, most of them without a full amount of information.  Teaching this is a skill on its own, and we need to cultivate and value it.

2. A new teacher should have have a greater or more difficult work load than an experienced or mid-career teacher.  That's f-ing stupid, and everyone knows this.  Currently, regardless how experienced you are, you are paid to work about 5 hours in front of a class, and about 2.5 hours of prep/grading/lunch.  A new teacher needs more time to prepare, and more time to grade.  This has to change.  There is no way a new teacher should be expected to take a full course load immediately, especially not in their first couple years.  There should be a phase-in time (explained later) that represents your skills and knowledge.

3. Some teachers are good at some things, other teachers are good at other things, and we need to acknowledge that. We all know the quote: “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Okay, first off, Einstein almost certainly didn't say that, but whatever, it's a good quote.  Just because it's a good quote doesn't mean you need to attribute it to someone smart.  It probably came from an old book in the 1800s, but that is besides the point  We evaluate teachers based on what their students learned sometimes, or sometimes we evaluate teachers on their willingness to kiss admin's ass.  But we don't evaluate them on what they're actually doing most of the time.  We have teachers who are good at developing cool curriculum.  We have teachers that are good at running difficult classrooms.  We have teachers that are good a leading departments.  Hell, in my school we have a teacher who is a bloody genius at schedules.  We all have our things, and we don't value those, especially not formally.

4.  Some teachers should be allowed to just be good teachers, and left alone.  This isn't Lake Wobegon.  I had a fellow educator argue that ""Shouldn't all teachers be great?""  No.  That's not possible.  At every job there are people who are below-average.  There are some that are struggling, and need time to improve.  There are some that just want to have a stable job.  And in nearly no other job would we attack them for it.

So, here is how I envision teaching in a nearly-ideal situation:

There will be different types of teachers, based on their skills and interests.  They will be placed into situations that allow them to succeed and flourish.  There will be a real and sustainable system for training, developing, and maturing teachers.

When you start out, you will get a Professional Teacher Trainer.  They will be a classroom teacher, but also will be someone who is good at and enjoys training future teachers.  They will be good at integrating a learning teacher into their classroom.  They will become experts at this specific job.  They will have fewer expectations for classroom instruction time, since part of their instruction will not just be their students, but also their teachers-in-training.  During this time you are an employee of the district, not a student.  The pay would be more similar to an intern, but that’s really what they are.  They would begin the job of being a teacher, and slowly they would take over more classroom duties, and the Teacher Trainer would be working to make them better as they observed their classroom.

In your first 2-4 years, you would be a Teacher 1.  These positions would teach about 60-75% of what full-time teachers teach.  They would also be aided by Teacher Trainers, more as an advisory role.  Teacher 1s would advance as their teaching improved and this would be decided by administration and advised by the Teacher Trainers.  If a Teacher 1 was able to show that they were performing well enough, they could have an external evaluator come and determine whether or not they were good enough to advance.

As a Teacher 2, you would earn more than a Teacher 1, but also have greater expectations.  You would have a “full” class load, but would not be expected to deal with overcrowded classrooms, or the most difficult students or work environments.  You would have the expectations of a normal teacher, and if you were not able to perform these expectations, you may be demoted to a Teacher 1, so that you can improve again.  Some teachers may actually choose to go back down to a Teacher 1, if their life calls for it.

As a Teacher 3, you are now a master teacher.  You can deal with the most difficult classes, or handle classes that are at maximum capacity.  You are great at what you do, and you are paid for it.  You are the epitome of a great classroom teacher.  And that’s what you are.  You do not have pseudo-administrative duties shoved on to you.  You are just allowed to teach and be great at it.

But you can also choose to diversify, and explore other options.

You could choose to be a professional Teacher Trainer.  You would take classes on how to train teachers, and how to integrate teachers.  Your teaching workload would be reduced, but you would have other expectations.

You could choose to become a Curriculum Specialized teacher, where you have a lower class load, but are expected to generate curriculum for other teachers in the district, or in the area.  You would lead trainings, but would still be in the classroom.  WAY TOO OFTEN former teachers are developing curriculums while no longer in the classroom.  They might be admin, or some other district office employee, but they’re now disconnected from what is actually going on, and it shows.  This has to stop as well.

You could become a Department Administrator, where your teaching time is reduced, but you are expected to take the load off of other teachers, and also work in a position where they are doing some of the work that administration is currently bogged down with.  This would also keep administration decisions informed by classroom teachers.  You would also be a better evaluator of teachers than administration, as you would have direct knowledge of how to teach in that field.

And if a teacher chose to step away from one responsibility, they could go to a Teacher 3, or even a 2, if they wanted to reduce their teaching load for personal reasons.

This is not a perfect system, but no system is.  There might be some disagreement on who should be able to do what, but let’s be honest, that’s how real work… works.  That’s why unions and management work together.  But this is a hell of a lot better than what we do now.

So, bitching is easy.  My first period students have it down to an art form.  I had a student complain that because of all their extra credit, their grade couldn't go up any more.  Such is life.

What is the solution?

Make teaching a job that people actually want to go into, want to stay in, want to get better at, and want to compete for.

Here's how I think you do it:

1. Teacher training should be done by people who are actually experts at training teachers in the classroom.  This is a very distinct skill that is different from being a good teacher.  And it is NOTHING like being a professor.  Professors know a LOT about a little.  Teachers have to know a little about a LOT, and they have to be able to make 1000 decisions in a second, most of them without a full amount of information.  Teaching this is a skill on its own, and we need to cultivate and value it.

2. A new teacher should have have a greater or more difficult work load than an experienced or mid-career teacher.  That's f-ing stupid, and everyone knows this.  Currently, regardless how experienced you are, you are paid to work about 5 hours in front of a class, and about 2.5 hours of prep/grading/lunch.  A new teacher needs more time to prepare, and more time to grade.  This has to change.  There is no way a new teacher should be expected to take a full course load immediately, especially not in their first couple years.  There should be a phase-in time (explained later) that represents your skills and knowledge.

3. Some teachers are good at some things, other teachers are good at other things, and we need to acknowledge that. We all know the quote: “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Okay, first off, Einstein almost certainly didn't say that, but whatever, it's a good quote.  Just because it's a good quote doesn't mean you need to attribute it to someone smart.  It probably came from an old book in the 1800s, but that is besides the point  We evaluate teachers based on what their students learned sometimes, or sometimes we evaluate teachers on their willingness to kiss admin's ass.  But we don't evaluate them on what they're actually doing most of the time.  We have teachers who are good at developing cool curriculum.  We have teachers that are good at running difficult classrooms.  We have teachers that are good a leading departments.  Hell, in my school we have a teacher who is a bloody genius at schedules.  We all have our things, and we don't value those, especially not formally.

4.  Some teachers should be allowed to just be good teachers, and left alone.  This isn't Lake Wobegon.  I had a fellow educator argue that ""Shouldn't all teachers be great?""  No.  That's not possible.  At every job there are people who are below-average.  There are some that are struggling, and need time to improve.  There are some that just want to have a stable job.  And in nearly no other job would we attack them for it.

So, here is how I envision teaching in a nearly-ideal situation:

There will be different types of teachers, based on their skills and interests.  They will be placed into situations that allow them to succeed and flourish.  There will be a real and sustainable system for training, developing, and maturing teachers.

When you start out, you will get a Professional Teacher Trainer.  They will be a classroom teacher, but also will be someone who is good at and enjoys training future teachers.  They will be good at integrating a learning teacher into their classroom.  They will become experts at this specific job.  They will have fewer expectations for classroom instruction time, since part of their instruction will not just be their students, but also their teachers-in-training.  During this time you are an employee of the district, not a student.  The pay would be more similar to an intern, but that’s really what they are.  They would begin the job of being a teacher, and slowly they would take over more classroom duties, and the Teacher Trainer would be working to make them better as they observed their classroom.

In your first 2-4 years, you would be a Teacher 1.  These positions would teach about 60-75% of what full-time teachers teach.  They would also be aided by Teacher Trainers, more as an advisory role.  Teacher 1s would advance as their teaching improved and this would be decided by administration and advised by the Teacher Trainers.  If a Teacher 1 was able to show that they were performing well enough, they could have an external evaluator come and determine whether or not they were good enough to advance.

As a Teacher 2, you would earn more than a Teacher 1, but also have greater expectations.  You would have a “full” class load, but would not be expected to deal with overcrowded classrooms, or the most difficult students or work environments.  You would have the expectations of a normal teacher, and if you were not able to perform these expectations, you may be demoted to a Teacher 1, so that you can improve again.  Some teachers may actually choose to go back down to a Teacher 1, if their life calls for it.

As a Teacher 3, you are now a master teacher.  You can deal with the most difficult classes, or handle classes that are at maximum capacity.  You are great at what you do, and you are paid for it.  You are the epitome of a great classroom teacher.  And that’s what you are.  You do not have pseudo-administrative duties shoved on to you.  You are just allowed to teach and be great at it.

But you can also choose to diversify, and explore other options.

You could choose to be a professional Teacher Trainer.  You would take classes on how to train teachers, and how to integrate teachers.  Your teaching workload would be reduced, but you would have other expectations.

You could choose to become a Curriculum Specialized teacher, where you have a lower class load, but are expected to generate curriculum for other teachers in the district, or in the area.  You would lead trainings, but would still be in the classroom.  WAY TOO OFTEN former teachers are developing curriculums while no longer in the classroom.  They might be admin, or some other district office employee, but they’re now disconnected from what is actually going on, and it shows.  This has to stop as well.

You could become a Department Administrator, where your teaching time is reduced, but you are expected to take the load off of other teachers, and also work in a position where they are doing some of the work that administration is currently bogged down with.  This would also keep administration decisions informed by classroom teachers.  You would also be a better evaluator of teachers than administration, as you would have direct knowledge of how to teach in that field.

And if a teacher chose to step away from one responsibility, they could go to a Teacher 3, or even a 2, if they wanted to reduce their teaching load for personal reasons.

This is not a perfect system, but no system is.  There might be some disagreement on who should be able to do what, but let’s be honest, that’s how real work… works.  That’s why unions and management work together.  But this is a hell of a lot better than what we do now.

I brought up my concerns that he has missed SO MUCH of my class and I don’t see how he’s going to make up the instruction he needs.

I find it difficult to articulate my frustrations, but I am so fed up with adults in education at my school expecting me to “give them work” to make up for lost learning. Completing packets does not equal learning!

I was in my A Game while doing a little direct instruction and was joking and having great discussions with my small class. The whole day was so nice.

I know all days won't resemble today but holy shit did I need it. Monday absolutely sucked but Tuesday was amazing, and hopefully I can keep the good vibes going the rest of the week. Just needed to type this out.

It's an interesting field, especially as you get deeper into it, and you start to realize that you can design a research project to find nearly any result that you want, if you're willing to be unscrupulous about it.

For example, a certain agricultural manufacturer wanted to show that their product had no effect on animals living in the soil.  So, what they did was spray a very small amount of product on three earthworms, and didn't spray that small amount on three others.  Then, after a very short period of time, they showed that the product had no effect at all on the worms.  The worms actually shrunk by 33% on average, but because the variability of worm size is so great, the effect was not significant.  They then came the the conclusion that their product had zero effect on the entire ecosystem, due to this single experiment on a single species.  The study was irrefutable, as it is absolutely 100% a scientifically correct study.  There was replication, and the effect was not significant.  And those without science degrees or knowledge of how the experiment was designed could herald it as a scientific study that showed exactly what they wanted to see.

As I arrived into the education world, I was still in the mindset of someone who studied experimental design.  I started looking at some of the case studies, and the research that was coming out of the education field.  It was abysmal.  The design didn't match the conclusions.  There was an intent to create effects where there wasn't by reducing the population to small numbers, and selecting specific data sets after analysis.

So what I want to talk about first is how to design research so that the the results look significant when they're not.

1) Design the test to fit the results you want.

This is the most common method used.  You can actually see it with nearly every curriculum, as they very closely control who gets to see the actual test questions.  Normal, and valid, testing methods use a huge test bank of questions, and choose randomly from those questions.  You'll see test bank sizes of upwards of thousands of questions for a well-designed experiment.  This allows the researcher to see the effects of not just the independent variables, but also to tease out unintended effects of question order, test size, etc.

However, for a lot of the new tests, you won't see many, or even ANY of the test questions.  They might give a very limited set of release questions.  They will say that they want to keep them secret.  Any time you hear or see this, know that this *automatically* makes the test flawed.  This means that the test question bank is so small as to allow the variability of questions themselves to alter the results significantly.  For instance, the most statistically valid test in the United States is the SAT.  They release hundreds, if not thousands, of test questions per year.  They know the independent effect of individual questions, the effect of length, the effect of order.  Often testing companies will say that they only have a certain number of questions written, or that they cannot reveal the specific test format.  This is unequivocal bullshit.  Statewide tests are funded to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per year.  You don't think they have enough time or money to do a full set of test questions?  In fact, they DO have a huge set of test questions.  But by limiting the test questions that align with the results wanted, they can predict results before testing has even begun.  Often they will know what questions students will do poorly on based on preliminary tests with specific districts.  (Hey, my district just got an offer to give the test to our students a year ahead!  What luck!)

Are you looking to sell a curriculum in the future?  Then put on questions that you know students will do poorly in.  Don't release any practice questions even SLIGHTLY similar to those that the students will see on the test.

Now, after the students have used the curriculum, NOW they will see questions that are nearly identical to the questions in the curriculum.  Questions will be phrased in the same way.  The words will be identical, or similar.  The conclusions will have equivalents in the problems already solved.

And this is why we're told to not discuss or look at the questions.  The tests are designed to match the curriculum, rather than match the needed knowledge.

2) Control the testing environment to produce the results you want.

This is a classic in a lot of biological studies.  If you allow me to control the environment, I can give you any result you could even conceive.  Let me control the environment, and I will be able to show that elephants have a positive effect on polar bears.

Have you noticed how an increasingly large numbers of these tests appear on computers?  That's not a coincidence.  It's not for ease of grading, or anything like that.  That's to help control the data.  By putting tests on computers, you can create confusion for the test-takers.  Hell, you can even boost test results by allowing students onto computers, as well.  You don't think that a student can figure a way around testing procedures?

You want good results?  Use the same interface that students have used for your curriculum?  You want bad results?  Use a confusing interface, that slows students down.  You want REALLY good results?  Allow students to find ways to access the internet, even as you say that it's not possible.

3) Have as many sub-groups as you can devise, and then see what sticks.

""Our curriculum increased the reading level of Title I students by XXX percent!""

First off, no it didn't.  See parts 1 and 2.  Second, you are using that specific group because that's where you saw an effect that looks big.  One time I saw a result that said their curriculum increased the results for minority, free and reduced lunch, female students by some number.  This is a classic multiple qualifier that you should immediately recognize as garbage.  The more specific the qualifier, the less valid the data, and the more cherry-picked the number is.

I had a biostatistics professor who used to call this the ""Shotgun method"".  Basically, you fired at random at a data set, and saw what fell out.  Then you did the analysis afterwards, and came up with conclusions.  This is called ""post-hoc"" analysis, and it generally is absolute garbage.

4) Ignore variability.

This is a classic.  I have attended dozens of talks on educational data, and they are almost never presented by the actual statisticians.  Most statisticians won't get within 100 miles of the conclusions that are being made, so hand it off to a district office employee, a government employee, or a corporate salesperson.  The first question you should ask when watching these presentations is simply, ""What is your measure of variability for this study?""  Not once have I gotten an answer.  I've probably asked this question 40 times.  My favorite answer was ""Well, there are a lot of psychostatisticians working on this...""

The reason variability is important is because it puts the actual results in perspective.  For instance, I once bowled a 175.  Prior to that, I'd never broken 120.  I hardly ever break 100.  I'm a terrible bowler.  But if I tell you that I've bowled a 175, you might think I'm okay.  And that would be misguided.

The variability of most educational studies is massive.  Most of the data is actually random noise, as a result of the individual students, the day and time it was given, the method of giving the test, and the weather for the day.  The effect of the curriculum, the teacher, or the school is so small as to be eaten alive by all the variability.

One of the most terrifying statistics I saw presented was an attempt to compare schools by finding similar students at the schools, based on just one test score.  Basically, if a student had scored similarly to another student, they would be paired together, and then if one went up more than the other, it was said that the one that went up more had a better teacher/curriculum/school/district.  This didn't just ignore the effect of variability, it compounded it.  And this was the best data set that the entire state was willing to produce.  Again, not a single statistician in the room that was able to discuss the limitations of the data set.  Just a single district office employee.  But it was okay, because that data was good for us.

5)  Lie.  

Just make up data.  Fudge it.  Drop ""outliers"".  Refuse to allow others to see your complete data set.  Most of these proprietary data sets are held in secret because they need to be massaged.  Let's say you're comparing students that didn't use your curriculum versus those who did, but you've got a student in the non-curriculum-using population that is an absolute whiz.  A curve-wrecker.  Or even worse, a teacher who teaches better than your curriculum is able to teach to the test.  What do you do?  Well, they're called ""outliers"", and you drop them right away.  Dropping outliers is an important part of making data fit what you want.  It's absolutely against the rules, but it's like holding in the NFL.  It's happening all the time, the key is you don't get caught.  And if you've got a proprietary data set, you're not going to get caught, because the data is yours, and they can only see your results.

-------------------

And this gets to why whenever your school buys a new curriculum, you will nearly never get the results that they say they got.  They've designed their tests to match their curriculum.  They've adapted the environment to match what they want.  They've created sub-groups and presented the highest-performing one as the norm.  They've ignored all measures of variability.  And they've flat-out lied.",,False,False,Teachers,t5_2qqcs,,public,self,"How data is manufactured to make curriculum look valuable, and why it doesn't work when it comes to your school.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/7r7dhi/how_data_is_manufactured_to_make_curriculum_look/,all_ads,,1516269654.0,markdown,,,,a08128e8-420a-11e3-870c-12313d184137,Long and boring.  But important.,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-18 05:00:54+00:00,"How data is manufactured to make curriculum look valuable, and why it doesn't work when it comes to your school.Prior to becoming a teacher, I was trained in biostatistics and experimental design.  It's an interesting field, especially as you get deeper into it, and you start to realize that you can design a research project to find nearly any result that you want, if you're willing to be unscrupulous about it.

For example, a certain agricultural manufacturer wanted to show that their product had no effect on animals living in the soil.  So, what they did was spray a very small amount of product on three earthworms, and didn't spray that small amount on three others.  Then, after a very short period of time, they showed that the product had no effect at all on the worms.  The worms actually shrunk by 33% on average, but because the variability of worm size is so great, the effect was not significant.  They then came the the conclusion that their product had zero effect on the entire ecosystem, due to this single experiment on a single species.  The study was irrefutable, as it is absolutely 100% a scientifically correct study.  There was replication, and the effect was not significant.  And those without science degrees or knowledge of how the experiment was designed could herald it as a scientific study that showed exactly what they wanted to see.

As I arrived into the education world, I was still in the mindset of someone who studied experimental design.  I started looking at some of the case studies, and the research that was coming out of the education field.  It was abysmal.  The design didn't match the conclusions.  There was an intent to create effects where there wasn't by reducing the population to small numbers, and selecting specific data sets after analysis.

So what I want to talk about first is how to design research so that the the results look significant when they're not.

1) Design the test to fit the results you want.

This is the most common method used.  You can actually see it with nearly every curriculum, as they very closely control who gets to see the actual test questions.  Normal, and valid, testing methods use a huge test bank of questions, and choose randomly from those questions.  You'll see test bank sizes of upwards of thousands of questions for a well-designed experiment.  This allows the researcher to see the effects of not just the independent variables, but also to tease out unintended effects of question order, test size, etc.

No notice (typically the teachers know drills are coming) at 2:00 in the afternoon.  I found myself hesitating, noticed the kids were hesitating and waiting for my lead (I have planning 1st period so I thought - maybe there was notice I hadn't seen since then).  So checking my backdoors to see if other teachers were heading out - no one was coming out immediately (we have an indoor/outdoor campus).  I look around outside, then we see the kids next door start coming out. We hear on the intercom ""you must evacuate"" - never heard them do that before (I've been at this school 10-years).  Turns out there was a real problem in our gym in an air duct.     

The delay wasn't long, not even 30-seconds, but enough you could note the tension.  We went out, finally one teacher got a text from the front office saying what was going on.  When we got back inside the kids were saying - they were nervous.  I have wonderful kids (age 14ish).  I told them they were right to question circumstances and wait that extra half minute to assess what is going on.  Another kids thought it was good that it was a real fire because it would have been rude of the school to have a 2:00 fire drill after what happen south of us.

After school, I asked other teachers - one who was facing the inner campus said she had just convinced her kids to leave when the deputy went running across campus and a kid said ""*&amp;*, I'm not going.""

No notice (typically the teachers know drills are coming) at 2:00 in the afternoon.  I found myself hesitating, noticed the kids were hesitating and waiting for my lead (I have planning 1st period so I thought - maybe there was notice I hadn't seen since then).  So checking my backdoors to see if other teachers were heading out - no one was coming out immediately (we have an indoor/outdoor campus).  I look around outside, then we see the kids next door start coming out. We hear on the intercom ""you must evacuate"" - never heard them do that before (I've been at this school 10-years).  Turns out there was a real problem in our gym in an air duct.     

The delay wasn't long, not even 30-seconds, but enough you could note the tension.  We went out, finally one teacher got a text from the front office saying what was going on.  When we got back inside the kids were saying - they were nervous.  I have wonderful kids (age 14ish).  I told them they were right to question circumstances and wait that extra half minute to assess what is going on.  Another kids thought it was good that it was a real fire because it would have been rude of the school to have a 2:00 fire drill after what happen south of us.

After school, I asked other teachers - one who was facing the inner campus said she had just convinced her kids to leave when the deputy went running across campus and a kid said ""*&amp;*, I'm not going.""  Turns out the deputy was just running to the gym to make sure everything was ok at the gym.

The anxiety is real.   Interesting that so many classes, no matter how segregated had the same reaction.  Fascinating, really.

I have no doubt the youngest of them are in their 70s, with most well into their 80s, and more than a few will have passed on.  Still, I'll be content if I can reach any of them.

High school was not a happy time for me.  I had undiagnosed depression, family stress, few friends, and a raft of other factors that kept me socially withdrawn and an easy target for bullying.  I was also one of those obnoxious students who could get A's and B's without trying, so I was often disruptive in class out of boredom, but (almost) never to the point of being ""sent to the office"".  I tended to antagonize my teachers, so few were able to get through to me.  Those who did tended to teach subjects I was genuinely interested in learning.  At the time, I neither acknowledged nor appreciated their efforts.

I quit high school during the '73-'74 winter break and left the state, spending the time between leaving high school and entering the Navy working for minimum wage and going to night school to make up the few credits I needed for graduation.  So, technically, I'm part of the Class of 1975, though I'm in the '74 yearbook.

I forcibly buried my high school memories as I made my way in the world, and it is only now, at this cusp in my life and career, that I clearly see the long shadows several of my teachers have cast in my life.  Those listed above were calm places the midst of turmoil, structure within chaos.  None were in any way ""parental"", but they treated me as an adult, via their expectations.  Some even treated me as a colleague, when I worked with other students.   Most importantly, they treated me as someone having value in the world, as being worthy of respect, despite my poor self-image and behavior.  At the time, I simply thought I had them fooled.

Please let your staff know that it can take nearly half a century for some students to fully comprehend and acknowledge the effect special teachers have had in their lives.  But it's there, nonetheless.  It helped me become the person I am, and is influencing, perhaps determining, my next career choice.

I can hardly express how excited I am to become a teacher, despite knowing the hell my first two years will likely be, and the hell some of my students will likely be (memories can be harsh).  Fortunately, I have had some great role models, who I hope will be pleased to hear I'm paying it forward.

Things spiraled very quickly. Bill Ballanger came out and told these students how everyone thinks they're terrible and they should show these people up by standing politely when he asks.

I thought I was losing my mind since I was doing the same thing as last year but felt so much more stress and anxiety. Now I won’t lie there are admin changes, an overcrowded school, disciplinary issues, however, it was more than that I felt like I was burning out faster than ever.

This past week our county did a “teach to contract” meaning only work from 7:15am to 2:45pm. No after school grading, no planning, no coming in early to help students. At first I was a little annoyed, how would I get things done?! Then the week happened and I heard everyone else involved saying the same thing. We were burning out. But I learned more than that.

My students care more than my educational board. They understood I didn’t have time to grade and they weren’t upset or bothered. They saw me rushing in my classroom as the bell rung and some ran to hold my door open for other students and would say “miss go set up! We’ve got the door and the projector on for you!”. My students even started ushering each other out at 2:35pm saying “she needs to go home stop stressing her out.” My admin didn’t melt down or scream at me for not working harder (that one is a weird fear I have). No parents got upset that grades weren’t going in as fast. I slept in and still made it early enough to beat the student carpool rush. I left earlier and had time to care for my home life and myself. 

I didn’t get a lot of planning or grading done, but my stress my anxiety and my fears have decreased so much I started to think “why did I let myself do those things?” I know the answer is my students. I do it for them. The thing is they wanted me to keep doing this to an extent. My student started saying stop coming so early and staying so late you’ve been happier and more laidback this week than ever. 

Sometimes we forget self care. Don’t forget, it’s not just for you. It’s for them too.

I also said that sometimes it takes people months or even years to find a job because they keep getting turned down.

I thought it was like signing up for scholarships.” So I asked him what he meant, and he goes “well when our school offers scholarships, don’t the students just tell the principals they want it and then they get that money?” So again I explained that you also have to apply for scholarships and they usually get awarded to the most impressive or most deserving candidates, after applications are reviewed. Again, he looked confused, and goes “so it’s not just telling the principal you want that money?” No. I asked him if he’s ever wanted something that he didn’t get, and he said no, he’s never been denied anything that he cared about.

I'm kind of more shooting from the hip, based on my experience in the ""real world"" before becoming a teacher, and talks with my wife, who works for the government, but in a job that is considered more a ""professional job"" than teaching is treated.

So, first off, let's face it:  Teaching isn't a job for humans.  Humans need internal and external motivators.  Humans need about 10,000 hours of doing something to be really good at it.  Humans don't even have a fully-developed pre-frontal cortex until age 25.  Humans have different abilities, skills, interests, and phases of life.

Teaching, as a career, ignores all of these.

Generally, as a teacher, you go to some sort of teaching program that has some tangential value to when you get into the classroom.  You'll learn about taxonomy, and psychology, and you'll probably have a misanthropic special ed professor whose connection to reality is hanging on by a hair.

But, then you'll do your student teaching, where you'll be paired with a master teacher (hopefully) that will gently ease you into the process, and explain to you that 90% of your teaching program was a waste of your time and money.  They'll teach you some real classroom management, and give you some great lessons.  Or, they'll suck, and you'll pay up the nose for it, regardless.  No one will be willing to acknowledge that some people are good at training teachers, and some are not, and the system is generally be haphazard.

Then, after subbing (or not) for a while, where you're treated like garbage most of the time, and you'll be forced to jump between dozens of classroom management styles, you'll get your first teaching job.  Where you will teach full time, with basically no real teaching experience, in one of the most difficult schools, for very, very low pay.

I'm going to be honest, here:  What we do to new teachers isn't just bad, or wrong, it is bordering on inhuman and evil.  It isn't just wrong to do to the teachers, it's wrong to do to the students.  We are taking people (students and young teachers) when they're the most vulnerable, and putting them in the worst possible situations.  And, then, we're paying them so little that they would probably be better off waiting tables or delivering pizzas.

Quite often in these new teacher school environments, they are given little to no support, and almost everyone else there is in the exact same situation.  They are there to try to move on to a better job, surrounded by inexperienced or ineffective admin and other teachers, who are just getting their feet wet, or aren't able to get better jobs.

Most teachers don't actually make it out of this initial phase.  Most quite before finishing student teaching, subbing, or their first few years.  AND WE ACT LIKE THIS IS A GOOD THING!  We say that they just weren't cut out for it.  We find fault in them.  And yet, we (as a nation and an educational system) have set them up to fail.  We have done the equivalent of throwing a kid just out of boot camp into an F-15 in the middle of a dog fight in the first day.  And we blame them for failing.

So, if you survive to mid-career, you might be hoping to have children, or save up for a house.  But now you need to get a Masters degree, or a National Boards certification.  You're also expected to start to take some leadership because so many new ones are gone, and the old teachers are burned out, pissed off, and have been through that ringer a dozen times before.  And they're right.  It's a constant cycle of B.S. being sold, sometimes with new names, but it's all the same.

So, in mid-career, you're forced to make a decision, do you become a ""selfish teacher"" that focuses on family, do you go into administration and forsake teaching, or do you fall for the B.S. and become a stooge of the district, willing to go with whatever the current admin is going to come up with this week.

By the late career, the kids might be older, and perhaps are on to college.  But at this point, most are jaded and nihilistic towards education.  Perhaps now you're a department head if you've been willing to tow the party line.  Maybe you beat the buses out of the parking lot.  You've got most of your lesson plans memorized, and you make little tweaks as needed.

All the while, in the teaching pay scale, your biggest motivator is to just survive.  Literally.  The biggest effect you can have on your pay is generally to not die.  A new degree might help a little, but if you look at the biggest effect, it's time.

So, bitching is easy.  My first period students have it down to an art form.  I had a student complain that because of all their extra credit, their grade couldn't go up any more.  Such is life.

What is the solution?

Make teaching a job that people actually want to go into, want to stay in, want to get better at, and want to compete for.

Here's how I think you do it:

1. Teacher training should be done by people who are actually experts at training teachers in the classroom.  This is a very distinct skill that is different from being a good teacher.  And it is NOTHING like being a professor.  Professors know a LOT about a little.  Teachers have to know a little about a LOT, and they have to be able to make 1000 decisions in a second, most of them without a full amount of information.  Teaching this is a skill on its own, and we need to cultivate and value it.

2. A new teacher should have have a greater or more difficult work load than an experienced or mid-career teacher.  That's f-ing stupid, and everyone knows this.  Currently, regardless how experienced you are, you are paid to work about 5 hours in front of a class, and about 2.5 hours of prep/grading/lunch.  A new teacher needs more time to prepare, and more time to grade.  This has to change.  There is no way a new teacher should be expected to take a full course load immediately, especially not in their first couple years.  There should be a phase-in time (explained later) that represents your skills and knowledge.

3. Some teachers are good at some things, other teachers are good at other things, and we need to acknowledge that. We all know the quote: “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Okay, first off, Einstein almost certainly didn't say that, but whatever, it's a good quote.  Just because it's a good quote doesn't mean you need to attribute it to someone smart.  It probably came from an old book in the 1800s, but that is besides the point  We evaluate teachers based on what their students learned sometimes, or sometimes we evaluate teachers on their willingness to kiss admin's ass.  But we don't evaluate them on what they're actually doing most of the time.  We have teachers who are good at developing cool curriculum.  We have teachers that are good at running difficult classrooms.  We have teachers that are good a leading departments.  Hell, in my school we have a teacher who is a bloody genius at schedules.  We all have our things, and we don't value those, especially not formally.

4.  Some teachers should be allowed to just be good teachers, and left alone.  This isn't Lake Wobegon.  I had a fellow educator argue that ""Shouldn't all teachers be great?""  No.  That's not possible.  At every job there are people who are below-average.  There are some that are struggling, and need time to improve.  There are some that just want to have a stable job.  And in nearly no other job would we attack them for it.

So, here is how I envision teaching in a nearly-ideal situation:

There will be different types of teachers, based on their skills and interests.  They will be placed into situations that allow them to succeed and flourish.  There will be a real and sustainable system for training, developing, and maturing teachers.

When you start out, you will get a Professional Teacher Trainer.  They will be a classroom teacher, but also will be someone who is good at and enjoys training future teachers.  They will be good at integrating a learning teacher into their classroom.  They will become experts at this specific job.  They will have fewer expectations for classroom instruction time, since part of their instruction will not just be their students, but also their teachers-in-training.  During this time you are an employee of the district, not a student.  The pay would be more similar to an intern, but that’s really what they are.  They would begin the job of being a teacher, and slowly they would take over more classroom duties, and the Teacher Trainer would be working to make them better as they observed their classroom.

In your first 2-4 years, you would be a Teacher 1.  These positions would teach about 60-75% of what full-time teachers teach.  They would also be aided by Teacher Trainers, more as an advisory role.  Teacher 1s would advance as their teaching improved and this would be decided by administration and advised by the Teacher Trainers.  If a Teacher 1 was able to show that they were performing well enough, they could have an external evaluator come and determine whether or not they were good enough to advance.

As a Teacher 2, you would earn more than a Teacher 1, but also have greater expectations.  You would have a “full” class load, but would not be expected to deal with overcrowded classrooms, or the most difficult students or work environments.  You would have the expectations of a normal teacher, and if you were not able to perform these expectations, you may be demoted to a Teacher 1, so that you can improve again.  Some teachers may actually choose to go back down to a Teacher 1, if their life calls for it.

As a Teacher 3, you are now a master teacher.  You can deal with the most difficult classes, or handle classes that are at maximum capacity.  You are great at what you do, and you are paid for it.  You are the epitome of a great classroom teacher.  And that’s what you are.  You do not have pseudo-administrative duties shoved on to you.  You are just allowed to teach and be great at it.

But you can also choose to diversify, and explore other options.

You could choose to be a professional Teacher Trainer.  You would take classes on how to train teachers, and how to integrate teachers.  Your teaching workload would be reduced, but you would have other expectations.

You could choose to become a Curriculum Specialized teacher, where you have a lower class load, but are expected to generate curriculum for other teachers in the district, or in the area.  You would lead trainings, but would still be in the classroom.  WAY TOO OFTEN former teachers are developing curriculums while no longer in the classroom.  They might be admin, or some other district office employee, but they’re now disconnected from what is actually going on, and it shows.  This has to stop as well.

You could become a Department Administrator, where your teaching time is reduced, but you are expected to take the load off of other teachers, and also work in a position where they are doing some of the work that administration is currently bogged down with.  This would also keep administration decisions informed by classroom teachers.  You would also be a better evaluator of teachers than administration, as you would have direct knowledge of how to teach in that field.

And if a teacher chose to step away from one responsibility, they could go to a Teacher 3, or even a 2, if they wanted to reduce their teaching load for personal reasons.

This is not a perfect system, but no system is.  There might be some disagreement on who should be able to do what, but let’s be honest, that’s how real work… works.  That’s why unions and management work together.  But this is a hell of a lot better than what we do now.

I'm kind of more shooting from the hip, based on my experience in the ""real world"" before becoming a teacher, and talks with my wife, who works for the government, but in a job that is considered more a ""professional job"" than teaching is treated.

So, first off, let's face it:  Teaching isn't a job for humans.  Humans need internal and external motivators.  Humans need about 10,000 hours of doing something to be really good at it.  Humans don't even have a fully-developed pre-frontal cortex until age 25.  Humans have different abilities, skills, interests, and phases of life.

Teaching, as a career, ignores all of these.

Generally, as a teacher, you go to some sort of teaching program that has some tangential value to when you get into the classroom.  You'll learn about taxonomy, and psychology, and you'll probably have a misanthropic special ed professor whose connection to reality is hanging on by a hair.

But, then you'll do your student teaching, where you'll be paired with a master teacher (hopefully) that will gently ease you into the process, and explain to you that 90% of your teaching program was a waste of your time and money.  They'll teach you some real classroom management, and give you some great lessons.  Or, they'll suck, and you'll pay up the nose for it, regardless.  No one will be willing to acknowledge that some people are good at training teachers, and some are not, and the system is generally be haphazard.

Then, after subbing (or not) for a while, where you're treated like garbage most of the time, and you'll be forced to jump between dozens of classroom management styles, you'll get your first teaching job.  Where you will teach full time, with basically no real teaching experience, in one of the most difficult schools, for very, very low pay.

I'm going to be honest, here:  What we do to new teachers isn't just bad, or wrong, it is bordering on inhuman and evil.  It isn't just wrong to do to the teachers, it's wrong to do to the students.  We are taking people (students and young teachers) when they're the most vulnerable, and putting them in the worst possible situations.  And, then, we're paying them so little that they would probably be better off waiting tables or delivering pizzas.

Quite often in these new teacher school environments, they are given little to no support, and almost everyone else there is in the exact same situation.

This happens a lot with students who miss a lot of class or don’t do any of the assignments they received originally. 

I have one student who rarely comes to school before lunch. I have him 1st period, so he’s never here. My class is not only a class he needs to pass in order to move to 10th grade, but it also has a state test worth 20% of his grade that he will not pass without a lot of learning and practice. 

I brought up my concerns that he has missed SO MUCH of my class and I don’t see how he’s going to make up the instruction he needs. Rather than put him on homebound or even move his English 1 to the afternoon, the school psychologist and his guidance counselor said “let his dad know when he misses pertinent instruction,” as though this doesn’t happen every day.

For the many kids who miss school (even though they live in walking distance and on a bus route) or who never do anything in class, I am frequently asked to “give them work” to help them bring their grades up, as if there are magical packets that will teach them things, rather than just be busy work. 

I find it difficult to articulate my frustrations, but I am so fed up with adults in education at my school expecting me to “give them work” to make up for lost learning. Completing packets does not equal learning!

And the constant, mistaken assumption that every day is not an important day of learning in my class is so frustrating. Like my job is not to educate. Like I sit at my desk and hand out work and then take it back up all day long. Like I’m not working my butt off every day interacting with my kids and actually teaching.

Safe to say it's been an interesting experience so far. The school is much rougher than where I student taught and my classroom management has a long ways to go but I'm learning. Everyday my confidence is getting better.

Monday though straight SUCKED. My lesson was not structured right as the kids finished with way too much free time (still getting used to 80 minute blocks), I had to diffuse two situations that were about to become physical in my worst class, I felt as though we accomplished nothing, a few students commented about how out of wack the day was, and I left school in a daze.

I laid in bed feeling numb for a while just trying to take my mind off things.

Today though was the exact opposite. I had so much energy and the kids were feeding off of it in the best way possible. My worst class had a great day.

I was having a conversation with a 10th grade student in my class about their lack of motivation. So I steered the conversation towards their short term and long term goals.

""I'm going to play professional futbol.""

 Not ""I *want* to play professional futbol,"" *I'm going to.*

It took everything I had to not reply with ""are you fucking delusional?""

 Yes, there are more professional spots on teams open in futbol than any other sport in the world. And yes, you have been playing your whole life. But so have 1 billion other people with the same goal you have. How many openings do you think there will be in the ~5 years you have available to actually play professional sports before you're too old to be desirable for teams to pick up? 

Like, this shit drives me insane. We put *so* much emphasis on sports in schools, to the point of canceling actual academic classes like drafting, shop, art, music, elective sciences, elective writing courses, coding/IT, the list goes on. And you think, with your inability to even make the JV team on your no-name division nothing high school team that you'll go pro at 18? LMFAO. 

I get these kids. All. The. Fucking. Time. And I'm so sick of it. No, you can't be whatever you want when you grow up. You suck at soccer at 15, you have literally 0 chance of going pro. And now, you've had this dumbass pipe dream for as long as you can remember which has led you to believe that your academics don't matter because ""ima be famous and rich!"" 

It's the perfect recipe to make just another statistic in my inner city school. Stop feeding kids lies. Help them make realistic goals that are actually attainable instead of feeding into the ridiculous notion that we can all be Tom cruises, Kobe Bryants and Kanye wests. 

Edit: I didn't want to leave the impression that I simply crushed this students dreams and walked away. We had a halfway decent conversation about setting realistic goals, and specifically taking necessary steps to achieve those goals. How much said student bought into it I can't say, but it is what it is.

It's an interesting field, especially as you get deeper into it, and you start to realize that you can design a research project to find nearly any result that you want, if you're willing to be unscrupulous about it.

For example, a certain agricultural manufacturer wanted to show that their product had no effect on animals living in the soil.  So, what they did was spray a very small amount of product on three earthworms, and didn't spray that small amount on three others.  Then, after a very short period of time, they showed that the product had no effect at all on the worms.  The worms actually shrunk by 33% on average, but because the variability of worm size is so great, the effect was not significant.  They then came the the conclusion that their product had zero effect on the entire ecosystem, due to this single experiment on a single species.  The study was irrefutable, as it is absolutely 100% a scientifically correct study.  There was replication, and the effect was not significant.  And those without science degrees or knowledge of how the experiment was designed could herald it as a scientific study that showed exactly what they wanted to see.

As I arrived into the education world, I was still in the mindset of someone who studied experimental design.  I started looking at some of the case studies, and the research that was coming out of the education field.  It was abysmal.  The design didn't match the conclusions.  There was an intent to create effects where there wasn't by reducing the population to small numbers, and selecting specific data sets after analysis.

So what I want to talk about first is how to design research so that the the results look significant when they're not.

1) Design the test to fit the results you want.

This is the most common method used.  You can actually see it with nearly every curriculum, as they very closely control who gets to see the actual test questions.  Normal, and valid, testing methods use a huge test bank of questions, and choose randomly from those questions.  You'll see test bank sizes of upwards of thousands of questions for a well-designed experiment.  This allows the researcher to see the effects of not just the independent variables, but also to tease out unintended effects of question order, test size, etc.

However, for a lot of the new tests, you won't see many, or even ANY of the test questions.  They might give a very limited set of release questions.  They will say that they want to keep them secret.  Any time you hear or see this, know that this *automatically* makes the test flawed.  This means that the test question bank is so small as to allow the variability of questions themselves to alter the results significantly.  For instance, the most statistically valid test in the United States is the SAT.  They release hundreds, if not thousands, of test questions per year.  They know the independent effect of individual questions, the effect of length, the effect of order.  Often testing companies will say that they only have a certain number of questions written, or that they cannot reveal the specific test format.  This is unequivocal bullshit.  Statewide tests are funded to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per year.  You don't think they have enough time or money to do a full set of test questions?  In fact, they DO have a huge set of test questions.  But by limiting the test questions that align with the results wanted, they can predict results before testing has even begun.  Often they will know what questions students will do poorly on based on preliminary tests with specific districts.  (Hey, my district just got an offer to give the test to our students a year ahead!  What luck!)

Are you looking to sell a curriculum in the future?  Then put on questions that you know students will do poorly in.  Don't release any practice questions even SLIGHTLY similar to those that the students will see on the test.

Now, after the students have used the curriculum, NOW they will see questions that are nearly identical to the questions in the curriculum.  Questions will be phrased in the same way.  The words will be identical, or similar.  The conclusions will have equivalents in the problems already solved.

And this is why we're told to not discuss or look at the questions.  The tests are designed to match the curriculum, rather than match the needed knowledge.

2) Control the testing environment to produce the results you want.

This is a classic in a lot of biological studies.  If you allow me to control the environment, I can give you any result you could even conceive.  Let me control the environment, and I will be able to show that elephants have a positive effect on polar bears.

Have you noticed how an increasingly large numbers of these tests appear on computers?  That's not a coincidence.  It's not for ease of grading, or anything like that.  That's to help control the data.  By putting tests on computers, you can create confusion for the test-takers.  Hell, you can even boost test results by allowing students onto computers, as well.  You don't think that a student can figure a way around testing procedures?

You want good results?  Use the same interface that students have used for your curriculum?  You want bad results?  Use a confusing interface, that slows students down.  You want REALLY good results?  Allow students to find ways to access the internet, even as you say that it's not possible.

3) Have as many sub-groups as you can devise, and then see what sticks.

""Our curriculum increased the reading level of Title I students by XXX percent!""

First off, no it didn't.  See parts 1 and 2.  Second, you are using that specific group because that's where you saw an effect that looks big.  One time I saw a result that said their curriculum increased the results for minority, free and reduced lunch, female students by some number.  This is a classic multiple qualifier that you should immediately recognize as garbage.  The more specific the qualifier, the less valid the data, and the more cherry-picked the number is.

I had a biostatistics professor who used to call this the ""Shotgun method"".  Basically, you fired at random at a data set, and saw what fell out.  Then you did the analysis afterwards, and came up with conclusions.  This is called ""post-hoc"" analysis, and it generally is absolute garbage.

4) Ignore variability.

This is a classic.  I have attended dozens of talks on educational data, and they are almost never presented by the actual statisticians.  Most statisticians won't get within 100 miles of the conclusions that are being made, so hand it off to a district office employee, a government employee, or a corporate salesperson.  The first question you should ask when watching these presentations is simply, ""What is your measure of variability for this study?""  Not once have I gotten an answer.  I've probably asked this question 40 times.  My favorite answer was ""Well, there are a lot of psychostatisticians working on this...""

The reason variability is important is because it puts the actual results in perspective.  For instance, I once bowled a 175.  Prior to that, I'd never broken 120.  I hardly ever break 100.  I'm a terrible bowler.  But if I tell you that I've bowled a 175, you might think I'm okay.  And that would be misguided.

The variability of most educational studies is massive.  Most of the data is actually random noise, as a result of the individual students, the day and time it was given, the method of giving the test, and the weather for the day.  The effect of the curriculum, the teacher, or the school is so small as to be eaten alive by all the variability.

One of the most terrifying statistics I saw presented was an attempt to compare schools by finding similar students at the schools, based on just one test score.  Basically, if a student had scored similarly to another student, they would be paired together, and then if one went up more than the other, it was said that the one that went up more had a better teacher/curriculum/school/district.  This didn't just ignore the effect of variability, it compounded it.  And this was the best data set that the entire state was willing to produce.  Again, not a single statistician in the room that was able to discuss the limitations of the data set.  Just a single district office employee.  But it was okay, because that data was good for us.

5)  Lie.  

Just make up data.  Fudge it.  Drop ""outliers"".  Refuse to allow others to see your complete data set.  Most of these proprietary data sets are held in secret because they need to be massaged.  Let's say you're comparing students that didn't use your curriculum versus those who did, but you've got a student in the non-curriculum-using population that is an absolute whiz.  A curve-wrecker.  Or even worse, a teacher who teaches better than your curriculum is able to teach to the test.  What do you do?  Well, they're called ""outliers"", and you drop them right away.  Dropping outliers is an important part of making data fit what you want.  It's absolutely against the rules, but it's like holding in the NFL.  It's happening all the time, the key is you don't get caught.  And if you've got a proprietary data set, you're not going to get caught, because the data is yours, and they can only see your results.

-------------------

And this gets to why whenever your school buys a new curriculum, you will nearly never get the results that they say they got.  They've designed their tests to match their curriculum.  They've adapted the environment to match what they want.  They've created sub-groups and presented the highest-performing one as the norm.  They've ignored all measures of variability.

The delay wasn't long, not even 30-seconds, but enough you could note the tension.  We went out, finally one teacher got a text from the front office saying what was going on.

I told them they were right to question circumstances and wait that extra half minute to assess what is going on.  Another kids thought it was good that it was a real fire because it would have been rude of the school to have a 2:00 fire drill after what happen south of us.

After school, I asked other teachers - one who was facing the inner campus said she had just convinced her kids to leave when the deputy went running across campus and a kid said ""*&amp;*, I'm not going.""

- Mr. Fxxxxx, French

Do you have contact information for any of them?  If so, would you please forward this note to them?

Would it be possible for me to get a roster of all xxxxx teachers from '71 to '74?  I know I'll remember more names if I can review a list.

I have no doubt the youngest of them are in their 70s, with most well into their 80s, and more than a few will have passed on.  Still, I'll be content if I can reach any of them.

High school was not a happy time for me.  I had undiagnosed depression, family stress, few friends, and a raft of other factors that kept me socially withdrawn and an easy target for bullying.  I was also one of those obnoxious students who could get A's and B's without trying, so I was often disruptive in class out of boredom, but (almost) never to the point of being ""sent to the office"".  I tended to antagonize my teachers, so few were able to get through to me.  Those who did tended to teach subjects I was genuinely interested in learning.  At the time, I neither acknowledged nor appreciated their efforts.

I quit high school during the '73-'74 winter break and left the state, spending the time between leaving high school and entering the Navy working for minimum wage and going to night school to make up the few credits I needed for graduation.  So, technically, I'm part of the Class of 1975, though I'm in the '74 yearbook.

I forcibly buried my high school memories as I made my way in the world, and it is only now, at this cusp in my life and career, that I clearly see the long shadows several of my teachers have cast in my life.  Those listed above were calm places the midst of turmoil, structure within chaos.  None were in any way ""parental"", but they treated me as an adult, via their expectations.  Some even treated me as a colleague, when I worked with other students.   Most importantly, they treated me as someone having value in the world, as being worthy of respect, despite my poor self-image and behavior.  At the time, I simply thought I had them fooled.

Please let your staff know that it can take nearly half a century for some students to fully comprehend and acknowledge the effect special teachers have had in their lives.  But it's there, nonetheless.  It helped me become the person I am, and is influencing, perhaps determining, my next career choice.

I can hardly express how excited I am to become a teacher, despite knowing the hell my first two years will likely be, and the hell some of my students will likely be (memories can be harsh).  Fortunately, I have had some great role models, who I hope will be pleased to hear I'm paying it forward.

I teach HS English.

Yesterday, as part of a unit on cause and effect, I asked my 10th graders to write one sentence stating what their biggest problem was. I went around the room, silently checking to see if they were sticking to one sentence only. I saw some funny stuff and some scary stuff- kids worried about pregnancy, a kid with suicidal thoughts, kids whose parents tell them they're too fat...

Today, after grammar practice, I stood up, looked at the ceiling and said 'Yesterday, I looked at what you wrote. There were some funny ones and there were some that made me want to cry. I want to say that if you are facing a problem and you need some help figuring out a solution or just want to talk about it, I'm here. I've been here for 18 years. Some things I have to report- if someone's beating you up or you're in danger, I gotta tell someone- but if you just need to talk, my record for keeping a secret? And for not making things worse? Is a hundred percent. Come by. Even if you hate me, I care about every single one of you. Now, get out your vocabulary.'

I have to say, they looked kinda shocked. We covered words like 'credible' and I got to list credible reasons for breaking up with someone (namely, me, used by girls I dated in high school).

My seniors had a big test on 1984. 4th period? They read the chapter! They knew their stuff! And I was able to say to the big kid whom everybody thinks is kind of dumb (he's not), 'Hey, big kid? Seriously, this is the best response so far.' Very nice to see him smile shyly and shrug.

5th period? They most assuredly did NOT read the book and no amount of surly scowling at me and growling will change that. I got a lot of explanatory notes on why they didn't read chapter 4 and...one comic about the characters from chapter 3: https://imgur.com/TeWiNLS

-which isn't going to bring any points, but WILL lead to a good discussion of when to do what work and why.

Also: a few weeks ago, I helped a kid with a debate for another class. I told him half-jokingly that if he got an 'A', I deserved a quarter-pound of good Muenster cheese. Well, he got an 'A' and quickly discovered that his local grocery store had no idea what he was talking about. He told me to wait. Today, he brought in a HUGE block of Muenster, the good stuff, over a pound! 
https://i.imgur.com/AjVVRuO.png
 I laughed and quickly starting slicing off chunks and giving them to kids who looked like they needed it. There were a lot of kids who looked like they needed cheese!

I teach HS English.

Yesterday, as part of a unit on cause and effect, I asked my 10th graders to write one sentence stating what their biggest problem was. I went around the room, silently checking to see if they were sticking to one sentence only. I saw some funny stuff and some scary stuff- kids worried about pregnancy, a kid with suicidal thoughts, kids whose parents tell them they're too fat...

Today, after grammar practice, I stood up, looked at the ceiling and said 'Yesterday, I looked at what you wrote. There were some funny ones and there were some that made me want to cry. I want to say that if you are facing a problem and you need some help figuring out a solution or just want to talk about it, I'm here. I've been here for 18 years. Some things I have to report- if someone's beating you up or you're in danger, I gotta tell someone- but if you just need to talk, my record for keeping a secret? And for not making things worse? Is a hundred percent. Come by. Even if you hate me, I care about every single one of you. Now, get out your vocabulary.'

I have to say, they looked kinda shocked. We covered words like 'credible' and I got to list credible reasons for breaking up with someone (namely, me, used by girls I dated in high school).

My seniors had a big test on 1984. 4th period? They read the chapter! They knew their stuff! And I was able to say to the big kid whom everybody thinks is kind of dumb (he's not), 'Hey, big kid? Seriously, this is the best response so far.' Very nice to see him smile shyly and shrug.

5th period? They most assuredly did NOT read the book and no amount of surly scowling at me and growling will change that. I got a lot of explanatory notes on why they didn't read chapter 4 and...one comic about the characters from chapter 3: https://imgur.com/TeWiNLS

-which isn't going to bring any points, but WILL lead to a good discussion of when to do what work and why.

Also: a few weeks ago, I helped a kid with a debate for another class. I told him half-jokingly that if he got an 'A', I deserved a quarter-pound of good Muenster cheese. Well, he got an 'A' and quickly discovered that his local grocery store had no idea what he was talking about. He told me to wait. Today, he brought in a HUGE block of Muenster, the good stuff, over a pound! 
https://i.imgur.com/AjVVRuO.png
 I laughed and quickly starting slicing off chunks and giving them to kids who looked like they needed it. There were a lot of kids who looked like they needed cheese!

My other courses are pre-AP and a 10th grade accelerated pre-IB AP Lit where the kids will go on to IB HL next year (this one, I'll plan/grade the whole time and co-teach). 

This year, I have a student teacher (ST) who doesn't see the value in teaching the standards. At first, I thought the ST just needed exposure/experience, but yesterday, the ST said the issue was that the standards shouldn't even be taught. Like, at all. This was the conversation:

ST: But why do the standards even matter? At [university], they teach us that each person should develop their own teaching style.

Me: Of course, you should, but style is the how and the standards are the what. I have autonomy to decide HOW I teach something, but it's important that I teach all these things within the year - they're the whats - and we plan out a scope and sequence as a PLC for when. 

ST: But the what is the book or the article. Who cares what they do with it? 

Me: No, that's part of the how for the most part. There are a few content pieces, like whole genres (plays, poems, seminal documents, etc), that have to be taught in the what of the standard at some point, but which texts is the how. Skills are more important than content in English courses. 

ST: But who cares if they can determine an author's perspective? The standards don't make any sense. 

Me: The state and me? And their next English teacher? Also, it's a useful skill. They can find bias in an article they read, better understand an email sent by a colleague, etc. 

ST: I think all these standards just turn kids into robots. 

For the record, my school does not require we use scripted or canned materials, we don't really do much test prep. My whole PLC is very dedicated to strong planning and we spend our time on actual activities: projects, papers, games, centers, gallery walks, jigsaws, close reads, etc, not on test prep. We know the tests and standards so the kids don't have to. 

But my ST is almost refusing to plan with our reading standards (which are based on the Common Core standards that, in my subject area at least, reflect basically what an English teacher should be teaching). 

The ST has tried this process (just reading the kids something and saying ""talk about it"" basically, also just giving them a picture and hoping they'd ask questions about it randomly) and I hoped would realize the error in it when the kids weren't focused and on task, but no such luck. Now, I'm all for pulling engaging texts and that's why we have thematic units. I'm all for bringing in real world issues and stuff kids care about. In fact, I kind of insist upon it. But I think there needs to be a focus on the teacher's part in terms of WHAT do we want them to do, HOW are we going to get them there, and WHY does it matter. And all my ST wants kids to do is ""be curious"" which is impossible to plan a HOW or WHY for and even if achieved, doesn't necessarily lead to growth in the particular skills my course is responsible for teaching them. (I'm not discouraging curiosity; I just think it's not everything.) 

This ST has some other weird ideas like conflating Marzano/Danielson rubrics with ""the standards"" and Blooms with the standards (all bad, apparently, though I'm not crazy about the Marzano stuff as an evaluation system, so I get that one). This ST is the first I've gotten from the private university nearby (my others have been from the big, public one) so it may be a program issue, IDK. I'm going to contact the program coordinator if the ST doesn't fix up the lesson plans for next week, basically over the weekend and incorporate the standards, but I didn't even know what to say to this conversation. 

So far, I have only let the ST fully take over one class (I still have to supplement planning b/c when the ST submits it, it has no goal) and I can't move forward with more until the planning aspect gets better. It's absolutely driving me crazy the wasted time in even this one class. The students have no goal, so they are starting to check out entirely.

I'm a 9th grade English teacher at a Title I school in Louisiana. We are preparing our students for a state test where they must receive an 80 or higher, however, on all the interims we have done, they have made 20s or lower. In fact out of 100+ students, my two highest scores were a little over 45. 

At first, this did not bother me. I truly believed that even though it may take a lot of hard work, we could achieve this goal. However, Friday, we were doing some test preparation for constructed responses and one of the questions asked, ""Explain the significance of the title of the text"" and many students got the answer wrong because 1) they do not know what significance means and 2) they cannot do literary analysis by themselves. The tipping point for me was when several kids said, ""Miss, how can we answer the question if we can't even understand what its asking us?""

Ever since then, Friday I have felt defeated. That I am constantly setting these kids up to fail a test they probably cannot even take because they are so behind grade level. And while I am doing the best I can to bring them up, to prepare them, there is only so much I can do and I feel like it will not be enough. 

I came into this profession to help students think critically, but I feel like all I am doing is teaching them to take a test that they will fail. I have considered teaching lower grades such as middle school, to help build a better foundation for when they go to high school. But because I feel the education system in this country is just such an abyss of hopelessness in failing our children, I honestly don't see the point of being an educator anymore.

I think instead of being angry and upset at the state of education I want to end my time as a teacher on a high note: the love and joy. So here is a list of thank yous that I will say on my last day in June: 

Thank you to my admin staff. You were the best I could have hoped for- supportive and caring. You are everything right with our system right now. Thank you a million times for supporting and not judging. 

Thank you to my paras and all paras in the world. You are underpaid and overworked. I’m in ESE so you are also beat up. Keep going and trying- the kids love you so much and I know you love them too (because lord knows you wouldn’t do this job for that pay if you didn’t)

Thank you to my classroom parents. You give me hope for the babies that I teach. You advocate and care. You send them to me warm and fed and clean when I know that you are cold and tired and hungry. 

Thank you fellow teachers for eye rolling at the right moments, laughing with me, crying with me, and just being so terribly honest it hurts. You’re fun and you make this heartbreaking job better. 

Thank you to all school staff. Front office for keeping the crazies away, custodians for handling what even I don’t want to handle. You are amazing and under appreciated. Our schools could not run without you! 

Thank you to my babies. You are the light of my day and bring me an amazing amount of happiness. You are so smart and perfect. I hope to help build a world who sees that too. I am sorry I wasn’t strong enough to do this job longer. 

And finally thank you, fellow teachers. I know how you are feeling. I know the heartbreak and the stress. I know how it feels to try so hard only to see that it’s not good enough. You are amazing. You are making a difference. You are all wonderful. I’m sad I can no longer call myself one of you. 



This is already horribly long but I do want to say this: I currently have a dream school with a dream class and a dream staff. I am still overwhelmed and struggling. I am sad to leave teaching, but the most upsetting thing to me was seeing the joy others felt with it that I so desperately wanted but never had. All I can promise in the future is that I will be the best parent I can be to your student- and also not be the crazy classroom parent.

I wanted to do a tableau with my first graders as part of retelling the events of a book. Tableau is a fun activity where five students all pose as if they were in a picture, and the audience has to guess the theme or event based off of the poses and the one line of dialogues the students get.

So I read a fun little book about a unicorn who thought it was a narwhale to the kids. I explained the activity, and they all nodded their heads in agreement that they understood. That was my first mistake, NEVER trust first graders when they ALL somehow understand the directions the first time.

I split them off into groups and let them work on their scenes. And this was my second error: Trying to manage four groups of six year olds while they all try to do an activity they don't understand is nearly impossible. Not only that, but the two students who I really wanted to lead their groups and show their creativity both went down crying in the middle of the lesson for separate reasons.

So my CT and supervisor are watching a frazzled intern run around the class trying to comfort two crying kids while working to explain a conceptual activity to students who have no idea what was going on, and they're just chuckling to themselves.

My kids didn't understand that after I said it a dozen times so they were showing swimming while moving their arms and literally miming an entire game of volleyball. It was awesome!

So in the end, the lesson went horribly and I definitely missed the point of why my students were doing the activity in the first place. I gave feedback that went over the kids' heads while two sobbing students and two chuckling superiors sat in the back of the room with me.

I feel both free and like I failed. I don't really feel happy, but I also don't feel burdened anymore. My admin was shit. They didn't support me at all. It was all talk from the very beginning.

I feel guilty because I feel like I abandoned my students. I made it clear to them that I was not leaving because of them.

Add that to the fact that I just found out I am pregnant (and suuuper morning sick), I simply can't do it any more. I never wanted to be a statistic, but here I am. 1.5 years of teaching and I'm out.

I am (was) the music teacher so I teach every kid in my school. One of my Kindergarten classes has 30 kids in it and no aid! The other Kindergarten classes are between 25-29 and the other grades cap at 32. In total I teach about 180 kids per day with a couple of preps thrown in occasionally, which adds up to about 800 kids per week. Grading is a joke. There is absolutely no way. My room is two small offices they knocked out a wall between. It would barely fit 10 comfortably without any equipment, let alone 32 plus a piano and equipment.

My admin regularly returns my disciplinary referrals and it is a crap shoot with behavior intervention...if I have a serious issue that I truly can't handle, sometimes they'll send me someone and sometimes they will apologize and tell me they can't because everyone is busy.

Once I had a kid who wasn't feeling well shit his pants in my class (poor thing) and when I sent him to the office to call home and get cleaned up they sent him back to me and told me to ""deal with it"" -- meanwhile I had 30 other kids I was trying to teach while trying to keep the whole thing covert so the poor kid didn't get embarrassed.

Another time a child with an EI had a meltdown and injured another child in my classroom. I called admin for backup and they told me to just ""deal with it."" 

Once I had a large 5th grader (I am a 5' 2"" small woman) put his face within inches of mine and demand I let him play with an iPad ""or else, bitch."" His punishment? To write me a half-assed apology letter that was about 2 lines long and nothing else.

Today I had to sit with a different 5th grader for 20 minutes during my lunch while he ranted and verbally abused me (swearing at me, calling me names, threatening me, etc.) before someone would come and relieve me so I could go eat my lunch. He refused to leave my room after his class (which happened to be right before my lunch) because he got mad when I moved him away from his friend whom he had been talking to and confiscated his cell phone.

Teaching Sammy to Add

I created this document as a compilation of incidents but it could easily have happened just as I wrote it. I didn't want to make my current students identifiable, which is why I used memory rather than current events. 

Me: Okay, Sammy, let's look at what's causing you problems here. What do you want to do? 
Sammy: I need to add these numbers. It's too hard. 
Me: it might feel a little hard now, but don't worry- I'm going to show you lots of ways to help. So the numbers are 6 plus 3…
Joey:  I don't feel well. My tummy hurts. 
Me: it's almost recess. Maybe you're hungry. Why don't you get a snack out of your lunchbox and see if that helps? 
Me: okay, so 6 plus 3. One thing that can help is using counters. 
Faith: Mrs D [the Reading Recovery teacher] says did you see my reading bag?
Me: no, Faith. Did you bring it back today? 
Faith:  Maybe. I think so. Did I give it to you? 
Me:  No, take another look in your backpack and on the floor under your backpack.
Faith:  Should I go tell Mrs D I can't find it? 
Me: Well, not until you actually look for it. But then if you can't, go tell her. 
Me:  okay, Sammy, so...counters. Right, counters. Can you get me some cubes please? 
Sammy: Where are they? 
Me: where we keep them. On the math shelf. Go take a look. You will need at least 10 unifix cubes. 
[EA returns to class with student who is on the autism spectrum] 
EA:  He's not having a great day. 
Me: Maybe he'd like a little down time. It's almost recess. He could go on the computer and listen to a book on GetEpic
EA: Okay, but he's not in a good mood. 
Me: I just need about ten minutes here. He usually settled on the computer. Let's give it a try. 
Me: Sammy. Did you get the counters? Oh, those are pattern blocks. Oh well, I guess they'll work. Sit right down and let's figure this….
EA: [ Loud scream.] He bit me.

Me: Um. Yes. Is there anyone available? 
Adam: [drops to floor. Sobs] 
Me:  It's okay buddy. It's okay. We’ll sort it out. It's okay. 
EA returns:  I washed it well. I think it will be okay. Mr P is with the new boy. He flipped over a desk in the classroom and told his teacher to - well, it was a very bad word. 
Me: Maybe Adam could go for a little walk down to the resource room. Adam, why don't you go get your snack and eat it in the Resource room. 
[Adam and EA leave. Adam is still sobbing loudly. Your heart breaks a little. He was doing so well]

If you have a child who is quiet, who maybe struggles with some concepts, but who isn't a behaviour problem - you might think the classroom will work well for your child. But in this scenario, your child may very well be Sammy. When the teacher is overwhelmed with demands and there is limited support in the classroom and the school for all the needs, it's very hard to find time for important tasks like teaching Sammy to add

It was one of the first times I have been able to spend a day interacting with people, and it seems like people like what I did.  I know it is corny but it really did warm my heart and help me shake off some of the depression from being stuck in the house.

For additional context (this is important) I teach in an Asian country. and thus there's a lot of emphasis on overachievement. I teach 15-17 year olds so most of them are getting to that stage where punishments and scoldings aren't going to be the most effective any more. 

On top of that, the syllabus is pretty advanced. For comparison the math department is working on imaginary numbers as well as statistical analysis (p-test and t-test, confidence interval).

I recently moved to NY and have been working on getting my license through reciprocity. 


NY state claims that my university degree is not comparable to a NY state institution therefore I do not meet the requirements for licensure. When I call to speak with them, I get a different “solution” each time:

I have my middle childhood education degree from Ohio. My university required we pick two concentrations. I chose ELA and Social Studies. I took 15 credit hours in each.


Fast forward. I’ve been teaching for four years in Washington D.C./Virginia. I was able to obtain an out of state license through reciprocity in both DC and VA. 


I recently moved to NY and have been working on getting my license through reciprocity. 


NY state claims that my university degree is not comparable to a NY state institution therefore I do not meet the requirements for licensure. When I call to speak with them, I get a different “solution” each time:


- “change your application to a different pathway”. Did not work.

This lesson is supposed to last all class period. I have lots of lessons and ideas to draw from but I keep getting stuck on certain things.

1) do I show visuals like a power point? How do I do this? I can't recall if there's a projector in the room. Or would that be too complicated anyway and I should keep it simple?

2) do I do a lesson that is supposed to start and finish in one class? I never do that .... things always evolve from learning techniques to sketches to final pieces. 

3) are they looking at how good the lesson is, or classroom management, or something else?

4) how am I supposed to know what they've been taught already? So I don't jump onto something too hard. Or worse, do something they have done already.

The storm was supposed to peak around 12-1:00, meaning by the time school lets out that afternoon, the ground would be a sheet of ice and driving conditions would be pretty risky. Local news stations advised everyone to avoid driving on Friday if at all possible. One teacher’s son is a meteorologist at a news station and he called his mom this morning warning her that going outside was a bad idea. So we all expected to close today but we didn’t.

I’m in a Catholic school, and our principals usually only close if the district right next to us closes (which they didn’t today). However, our principals can also decided to close on their own if they feel the need, but they don’t like to because they think it makes them look bad. Never mind that two other nearby Catholic schools canceled today of their own accord, and dozens of other nearby districts canceled. Additionally, numerous businesses actually canceled work today and told their employees to stay home. 

So about mid morning, our principals started getting angry calls from parents, saying if their boss told them it was too dangerous to come to work today, they want to know why the school is making kids come to school and parents drive on slick, icy roads. Apparently there were quite a few angry calls coming in. It was at this time, around an hour and a half after school had started, that they sent out a notification to parents saying if they could come pick up their kids early to please do so because the weather was getting too dangerous. All classes stopped, and we just basically had to babysit our classes while kids got picked up. And of course, for parents who still had to work, they couldn’t come get their kids, so teachers had to wait with students until 3:00 when buses came. They did let teachers go early who had to drive the farthest, though.

Honestly, this was embarrassing for the school. If you have to have parents call in and complain that they literally didn’t feel safe bringing their kids to school before you actually do something, then shame on you. We have plenty of snow days left to use this year so there’s no reason they should have put people in this situation. Parents were so inconvenienced by this.  They had to drop their kids off and go to work, only to be told an hour later that “oh sorry we decided to stop school after all. Come get your kids.” By the time I left, the parking lot was a sheet of pure ice. One teacher lives literally on the same street as the school and usually walks, and she was afraid to walk home because it was so slippery so she asked me to drive her, which I did. Like seriously, have a fucking backbone. Close the school and put the safety of your students and staff first. Today was a complete waste, parents were upset and had to go out of their way just because the principals thought it would make them look wimpy if they closed. Fuck this shit.

I teach grade 7 math at an international school with students that don't speak English as a first language. In September starting the school academic year I was told that student A is struggling a lot with math and has very low English ability. 
Throughout the year student A has tried really hard despite really struggling and regularly not completing work. However, since the start of the year, it felt like they've got a mental block when it comes to doing math (more than just a language barrier) - I'm also informed that they struggle equally in their native language classes. According to my admin, this has been ongoing with student A since they were new at the school. 

Fast forward to now, just over halfway through the academic year and student A seems to have totally given up. Since returning to school after the new year they have not submitted any work, and all of the worksheets given are completely blank. 

Student A sits at the front of the class currently to help them engage more in the lesson, and Student A also sits by students that work hard and are able to help them if they get stuck. 

During class time I make an effort to check on how they're doing, I try explaining how to do it and giving advice on how to answer the questions, they say Thank you and continue to stare at the page. If I try and stay longer to work through the questions and help they will ignore me completely or put their head on the desk and refuse to move or communicate. 

When trying to help Student A during free periods or during study periods when there are less students around, Student A will ignore me, put their head on the table and refuse to let me help or simply tell me they don't want help. If I ask them to come during their lunch break they don't show up.

When I try and talk to student A during class, before or after class I'm extremely careful to be friendly and encouraging so that I can try and encourage them to let me help them.

Third year teacher here wondering if I’m just wrong or if what I’m going through is normal. It is my third year at a Title 1 school and sometimes I just feel like I am not improving much year to year. One of the pictures that really helped me out in my first year was the timeline of a first year teacher where it’s really bad from September to December and then it  gets better and better. Now that I think about it, that is how I feel every year!

It might be that I am too hard on myself but every day I just barley feel like I made it through. I still have the dreaded Sunday pit in my stomach. For the most part, my group of kids are mostly really good but it’s the few that aren’t that derail my lessons sometimes. In addition, I’m having trouble getting students to hand in their work without constantly reminding them. I make parent contacts in my district regularly but I don’t feel like behavior changes all that much as a result. I remember seeing my favorite teacher come in and make it look so effortless and then there’s me who feels like every lesson is going to fall on its face. 

Additionally, my observations have all been really good thus far in my three years. I’ve fallen in the effective to highly effective range but then when it comes to delivering the lesson I feel like it’s my first day all over again. One of my admins recommendations last year was to have more confidence in myself and in the beginning of the year I did but I need a way to consistently confide in my pedagogy. In addition, the school has adopted an ELA initiative that we are to follow but at times feels a bit unnatural. It is strictly scripted and when I diverge from those plans although my students love those lessons, I feel guilty. 

Does this sound normal or is there something I need to do to improve? I really have always envisioned myself as a teacher and on my bad days I’ve found myself thinking what else might be out there for me. I want to make this a career for myself where I am not burned out and bring a contagious energy to table to inspire my students. Thanks in advance!

She scheduled parent-teacher conferences and ""back to school night"" with only 48 hours notice. She accidentally for the first few months of school was using the *wrong* school calendar for planning out when progress reports were supposed to go out. There are a lot of other things, but I am just going to keep it at this for now.

Right before winter break, she was telling us to give the students last minute makeup work, re-dos on old assignments, and ""extra credit."" In the couple of days before break, she called two meetings where she told us that we were had the lowest rate of attendance in the district and told us that it was the teachers' fault/job to fix it. Then she gave us 72 hours to:

* Finish up our grading before break
* Make 3 days worth of emergency sub plans that she would keep in case we were absent after break
* Complete a giant stack of paperwork to do for any student who was not able to get at least a C
* Write individual lesson plans for each student we are going to tutor after the break
* Develop an ""interdisciplinary collaborative lesson plan"" with someone not in our content area (that apparently we'll have to do sometime next semester, which makes it hard to plan)
* Complete two ""anonymous"" surveys to do (both of which asked questions where it'd be pretty easy to figure out who filled it out)
* Fill out another stack of paperwork that *we already had done* a month earlier because she lost the first set
* Fill out a ""self improvement plan"" and give it to her
* Thoroughly clean our classrooms (which wouldn't be bad if it weren't for all the other stuff)

At these meetings, she was telling us that we need to give more than 100% otherwise we weren't going to make it, and that if we couldn't give more than 100% that we should put in our two-week notices. 

During our break, we got emails from her every other day adding on things that we would need to do over break before we came back or things we would need to do on the day we came back. For instance today, she just sent us an email saying we would need to call our Homeroom students (~25 per teacher) every day they miss school.

But I think I burnt myself out already, and I can’t handle much more of the same treatment I got last semester. 

My first year I taught at a middle school, and it wasn’t the worst, but the students made the work environment very toxic, I didn’t have one class that I thoroughly enjoyed or looked forward to because the kids were just plain crazy. But there was limited after school requirements and the latest I ever stayed (other than performance nights) was 6:00. But with a whole new admin team coming in and a bunch of my favorite co-workers leaving, I chose to leave as well and transfer to a head theatre position at one of the high school. 

It was great at first. There was (and still is) a ton of things I had to learn and make adjustments to. I didn’t get my keys until a week before school started though, and I couldn’t get anything done due to my new responsibilities as auditorium manager and special events and meetings taking place at school. I was able to get things pieces together though, and survived my first few weeks. Then I started play rehearsals after school and wasn’t leaving school until after 8:00 by the time I got all my work caught up and everything set up for the next day. After a week of that and a miserable wife at home I started getting up earlier and getting to school by 6:00 at the latest to get my work from the day before done. Now that might sound like I just had poor time management and didn’t fully plan when to grade and lesson plan. However my plan has been taken over half of the year to cover other classes, or it has been taken for me to set up an assembly or performance in the auditorium. As the play grew closer, my rehearsals lasted longer. The show looked great, and went very well. But 4 weeks prior and the week after the show I worked just over 100+ hours per week at the school. I was able to get things pieces back together and take it easy for a few days while I got my schedule and planning pieces back together. But trying to give my classes two days of minimal work while I worked on things was not good for my classroom management. 

I had to fight tooth and nail to get them refocused on what should be done. And our administration does not follow through with discipline. They focus on telling us to teach the students the mastery of content. But when I have a couple students who disrupt everyone else’s attempt of those masteries (it’s theatre and very project based course) they will not give any disciplines and just tell the student that they need to be respectful of others. The students in the whole school treat each day like a party. They roam the halls, blaring music on speakers, they cuss and fight all the time in the hallways. There have been several students who skip class and go smoke weed outside my dressing rooms all the time and the principals never check the cameras or go check on the students when I tell them they are out there. 

In short. It’s led to a very toxic work environment with high stress and high demand of time. I was the top of my class in college and set the bar for my program along with great work in theatre. I’ve even been named all star teacher for the past two years (like the new teacher of the year, they only give teacher of the year to tenure teachers). There have been 6 teachers who have already quit this year. There will probably be a couple more who don’t come back from break.

Additionally, there are no resources. Everything comes out of my pocket. We are supposed to be a project-based learning and STEM school but any activities that I do with my students must be funded by me. I have spent $1,500 the first semester alone. 

Sorry to ramble. I'm just frustrated. I want to be an effective teacher but I need some help!",584,compound,-0.34,2018

I have a problem in that idk what my friggin problem is. I'm a ""first year"" teacher - using that term a bit loosely.

 I finished undergrad in 2011. Got a job in the Bronx that ended up being miserable. I was hired in October and I quit by January. To save from a wall of text I was in an environment that was unsupportive, the principal was basically setting me up to fail, I got observed and after our conference the last thing he said to me was ""let's face it, maybe teaching just isn't for you and you should find something else you would be good at."" and pointed to the door for me to excuse myself. At 23, I unfortunately believed him, quit not long after that meeting and didn't start teaching again until 2015, so three years later. (if you're interested in the nitty gritty details feel free to pm I just don't want this post to turn into a text wall.) 

I worked AS a teacher for an enrichment program but the demands on me weren't as high stakes as being an actual teacher in the district. At the end of that year I left the job and found a long term position in the district as a resource teacher. I really enjoyed it. The school wanted to hire me back as a second grade special ed teacher but I declined as I know special ed isn't my strength and am typically happier in general ed.

Found a position as a Gen ed. Second grade teacher and quit a month in because I couldn't handle the work load of being a full time teacher and half time grad school - became a daily sub - loved it.

Now I have a full time 6th grade position - Gen Ed, private school. 

I use the term ""first year"" loosely because I've started so many times but this is finally the first time, 6 years after I've graduated, that I have my own classroom in a permanent position.

My problem is I cannot figure out why I'm always so miserable. I always thought teaching is what I wanted to do, or what I was ""meant to do"" but every single time I find a permanent position or a long term position (save for my current right now) I've quit.

What is my problem? Should I really not be a teacher? Why haven't I found happiness in a career that I was convinced I'm meant to be doing? Am I chasing a unicorn with the belief that I'll find happiness ""if only"" or will it be the same that once I start at a new place that I will just become miserable again?

If I could find an IDEAL I would be anywhere from prek-3 - kindergarten teacher but beggars can't be choosers and I need to get into a district and establish myself first before I turn down jobs because they don't fit my perfect scenario. What else could I even do? What else would I even be happy doing?

I just need to reach out to other teachers as a sounding board who may also be willing to give me a spoonful of reality. I'm just really really struggling and Im to the point where I'm not being fair to my students. They could have a teacher who is so much better than I am or I could even be a better teacher for them if I was more positive and not so miserable.

This has been a really difficult post for me to write.

A little backstory for you--I'm a 4th year HS choir teacher. I have felt extremely successful as a teacher thus far, and each year I feel myself getting better at it. I have successfully directed two MS choral festivals. My evaluations have always been stellar, receiving consistent 3's and 4's throughout my career. I routinely send many kids to District and State Festivals. I keep the kids engaged and generally motivated throughout my rehearsals. My concerts receive praise from parents/educators/administration alike. I love my content.

So it may surprise you that right now, I want absolutely nothing to do with it anymore. I feel burnout happening quickly. November and December are tough for all music teachers--I found myself working 60 hours a week with all of the rehearsals and concerts going on in addition to the crazy schedule during the school day. It's just too much for me to handle. I love kids and making connections with them, but I just don't see myself keeping up with this schedule for the rest of my life. 

I have been considering other routes for a few years now, but I always stifled those ambitions because of the praise I received from being a teacher. I've created a persona with this career, and being honest with myself has been incredibly hard. When making pros/cons lists when considering leaving the field, most of my cons are ""guilt"" related, as in I feel a certain responsibility to be doing this, not that I would necessarily miss teaching.

I don't mean to sound conceited with my post. I guess I don't have a specific question, but more of a ""cry for help"" and guidance.

The show is intended to be a round table of teachers, and in our show the term “teacher” is defined as class room teacher or retired class room teachers.

For additional context (this is important) I teach in an Asian country. and thus there's a lot of emphasis on overachievement. I teach 15-17 year olds so most of them are getting to that stage where punishments and scoldings aren't going to be the most effective any more.

This is my first year teaching (High School English/ESL in BC, Canada).  I'm starting to realize that the amount of work I give out is too much and much of it is busy work.  I want to switch to giving out fewer assignments, letting students have more time for each thing, expecting higher quality, and having more time to look over and meaningfully mark each one with helpful feedback.  I think I've noticed that the more I give out the less the students care about it and the more it becomes busy work just for the sake of keeping them occupied.

The other side to this is that when I give students more time to do a bigger project/essay they don't use their in-class time effectively so I end up being overwhelmed and feeling like I have to give them busy work to keep them from acting up.

Any helpful experiences or words of wisdom along this line?  Thanks!

Background: 
I teach grade 7 math at an international school with students that don't speak English as a first language. In September starting the school academic year I was told that student A is struggling a lot with math and has very low English ability. 
Throughout the year student A has tried really hard despite really struggling and regularly not completing work. However, since the start of the year, it felt like they've got a mental block when it comes to doing math (more than just a language barrier) - I'm also informed that they struggle equally in their native language classes. According to my admin, this has been ongoing with student A since they were new at the school. 

Fast forward to now, just over halfway through the academic year and student A seems to have totally given up. Since returning to school after the new year they have not submitted any work, and all of the worksheets given are completely blank. 

Student A sits at the front of the class currently to help them engage more in the lesson, and Student A also sits by students that work hard and are able to help them if they get stuck. 

During class time I make an effort to check on how they're doing, I try explaining how to do it and giving advice on how to answer the questions, they say Thank you and continue to stare at the page. If I try and stay longer to work through the questions and help they will ignore me completely or put their head on the desk and refuse to move or communicate. 

When trying to help Student A during free periods or during study periods when there are less students around, Student A will ignore me, put their head on the table and refuse to let me help or simply tell me they don't want help. If I ask them to come during their lunch break they don't show up.

When I try and talk to student A during class, before or after class I'm extremely careful to be friendly and encouraging so that I can try and encourage them to let me help them. 

I have tried to talk to other teachers and my admin but no one seems to have a solution or any ideas. I also am unable to contact her parents.

During class time I make an effort to check on how they're doing, I try explaining how to do it and giving advice on how to answer the questions, they say Thank you and continue to stare at the page. If I try and stay longer to work through the questions and help they will ignore me completely or put their head on the desk and refuse to move or communicate. 

When trying to help Student A during free periods or during study periods when there are less students around, Student A will ignore me, put their head on the table and refuse to let me help or simply tell me they don't want help. If I ask them to come during their lunch break they don't show up.

When I try and talk to student A during class, before or after class I'm extremely careful to be friendly and encouraging so that I can try and encourage them to let me help them. 

I have tried to talk to other teachers and my admin but no one seems to have a solution or any ideas. I also am unable to contact her parents.

Does anyone have any advice or ideas? I want to do everything I can to help but I feel like every time I try anything I get nowhere. ",641,compound,0.9688,2018

Right before winter break, she was telling us to give the students last minute makeup work, re-dos on old assignments, and ""extra credit."" In the couple of days before break, she called two meetings where she told us that we were had the lowest rate of attendance in the district and told us that it was the teachers' fault/job to fix it. Then she gave us 72 hours to:

* Finish up our grading before break
* Make 3 days worth of emergency sub plans that she would keep in case we were absent after break
* Complete a giant stack of paperwork to do for any student who was not able to get at least a C
* Write individual lesson plans for each student we are going to tutor after the break
* Develop an ""interdisciplinary collaborative lesson plan"" with someone not in our content area (that apparently we'll have to do sometime next semester, which makes it hard to plan)
* Complete two ""anonymous"" surveys to do (both of which asked questions where it'd be pretty easy to figure out who filled it out)
* Fill out another stack of paperwork that *we already had done* a month earlier because she lost the first set
* Fill out a ""self improvement plan"" and give it to her
* Thoroughly clean our classrooms (which wouldn't be bad if it weren't for all the other stuff)

At these meetings, she was telling us that we need to give more than 100% otherwise we weren't going to make it, and that if we couldn't give more than 100% that we should put in our two-week notices. 

During our break, we got emails from her every other day adding on things that we would need to do over break before we came back or things we would need to do on the day we came back. For instance today, she just sent us an email saying we would need to call our Homeroom students (~25 per teacher) every day they miss school.

There have been several students who skip class and go smoke weed outside my dressing rooms all the time and the principals never check the cameras or go check on the students when I tell them they are out there.

This has been a really difficult post for me to write.

A little backstory for you--I'm a 4th year HS choir teacher. I have felt extremely successful as a teacher thus far, and each year I feel myself getting better at it. I have successfully directed two MS choral festivals. My evaluations have always been stellar, receiving consistent 3's and 4's throughout my career. I routinely send many kids to District and State Festivals. I keep the kids engaged and generally motivated throughout my rehearsals. My concerts receive praise from parents/educators/administration alike. I love my content.

So it may surprise you that right now, I want absolutely nothing to do with it anymore. I feel burnout happening quickly. November and December are tough for all music teachers--I found myself working 60 hours a week with all of the rehearsals and concerts going on in addition to the crazy schedule during the school day. It's just too much for me to handle. I love kids and making connections with them, but I just don't see myself keeping up with this schedule for the rest of my life. 

I have been considering other routes for a few years now, but I always stifled those ambitions because of the praise I received from being a teacher. I've created a persona with this career, and being honest with myself has been incredibly hard. When making pros/cons lists when considering leaving the field, most of my cons are ""guilt"" related, as in I feel a certain responsibility to be doing this, not that I would necessarily miss teaching.

I don't mean to sound conceited with my post. I guess I don't have a specific question, but more of a ""cry for help"" and guidance.

The show is intended to be a round table of teachers, and in our show the term “teacher” is defined as class room teacher or retired class room teachers.

I don't get to teach the fun parts of English that I love; I'm just stuck with teaching the grammar and writing.

I do still like my students on a personal level, as we can have conversations and I'm interested in who they are, I just don't necessarily like the professional side of it.

On top of my career-crisis, my admin have been really hard on me. I don't feel like they help me when I need them.

At the beginning of the year, one class had 37 students and I was only given 35 desks. When I tried to ask/help with a solution, I was basically told to just deal with it. 

At the beginning of December, I had my evaluation observation. I thought everything was going pretty well - I was following the lesson plans my teaching partner and I had planned while making small adjustments to make the lessons more *me*, I thought my students and I were getting along well, etc. I thought my observation went ok, it wasn't my best lesson, but it certainly wasn't bad by any means, and the students were pretty engaged except for one or two that always have trouble focusing. In our post conference, however, my observer put me on a growth plan because I don't plan my lessons well and I ""don't have any apparent relationships"" with my students.

That growth plan includes walk-throughs twice a week, weekly meetings, submit new classroom management strategies, submit how I'm going to build relationships, I have to within 2 weeks read 2 books and give 2 presentations on how to incorporate those ideas into the classroom, and many other things or I'm told I won't be rehired. This seems impossible to me, as I'm already struggling with everything. I feel like I've reached my breaking point and I am just done. I've been having small panic attacks every day just thinking about it all. I am ready to quit, but my family keeps telling me that I should push through because I don't want to abandon my contract.

I looked up contract abandonment for my state and it looks like all that would happen is a suspension for one year, as well as it being on my record. I'm thinking I probably won't teach again, but if I do, is it going to be impossible to get a job with that on my certification?

I give it nightly (always 20 minutes of reading and alternating either an online math program or a math worksheet each night). It is my first year and it is just so low on my priority list in terms of actually grading it and checking it. I feel like I have more control of what they are learning in the classroom than I do with their homework (many either have parents that practically do it for them or parents that are not around so it doesn't get done anyways... or they do it at their brother's baseball game or while watching tv... what I'm saying is that I don't think it is as effective of a tool for review as, say, a small group in the classroom or extra practice with a peer.) Anyways, It is a miracle if I can even plan what I'm teaching more than a day in advance so I honestly have let it fall by the wayside a bit. I'm hoping to get back on track with it after break but I'm honestly not looking for a system that will require me to do a lot of serious checking of homework because I just can't put that on my to-do list this year.


The biggest issue I have found is that I have had several parents express concern that their children are doing their homework each night but constantly forgetting to pass things in. I have a clearly designated pass in station right at the entrance of my classroom but many of my kiddos have fallen off the wagon a bit in terms of using it regularly. 


Here's what is making it complicated:

* I have a special immediately each day in the first 5 minutes after the kids arrive. So they all get in at different times from the bus in the morning and then I have to whisk them away to art or gym or whatever.

* I give verbal reminders and kids STILL don't pass things in even though they have them. I'm sick of hearing myself talk about it and I'm sure they are too.

* I don't have the time when we are back from specials to sit there and check in with every single student that they passed in homework because we have to hop right into our day since we have to squish in reading and writing in the hour and a half before lunch.

Anyways, I would really appreciate any advice anyone has on how I can kind of ""train"" the kids to get into the habit of getting their homework passed in each day without losing my mind or my voice!

I feel like I have more control of what they are learning in the classroom than I do with their homework (many either have parents that practically do it for them or parents that are not around so it doesn't get done anyways... or they do it at their brother's baseball game or while watching tv... what I'm saying is that I don't think it is as effective of a tool for review as, say, a small group in the classroom or extra practice with a peer.) Anyways, It is a miracle if I can even plan what I'm teaching more than a day in advance so I honestly have let it fall by the wayside a bit. I'm hoping to get back on track with it after break but I'm honestly not looking for a system that will require me to do a lot of serious checking of homework because I just can't put that on my to-do list this year.


The biggest issue I have found is that I have had several parents express concern that their children are doing their homework each night but constantly forgetting to pass things in. I have a clearly designated pass in station right at the entrance of my classroom but many of my kiddos have fallen off the wagon a bit in terms of using it regularly. 


Here's what is making it complicated:

* I have a special immediately each day in the first 5 minutes after the kids arrive. So they all get in at different times from the bus in the morning and then I have to whisk them away to art or gym or whatever.

* I give verbal reminders and kids STILL don't pass things in even though they have them. I'm sick of hearing myself talk about it and I'm sure they are too.

* I don't have the time when we are back from specials to sit there and check in with every single student that they passed in homework because we have to hop right into our day since we have to squish in reading and writing in the hour and a half before lunch.

Anyways, I would really appreciate any advice anyone has on how I can kind of ""train"" the kids to get into the habit of getting their homework passed in each day without losing my mind or my voice! I'm also down for changing up my system if it will make it easier and less stressful for my kiddos and me! :)",684,compound,0.9674,2018

However, especially working with deaf students (though I'm sure this varies school to school) the resources and expectations for English class can be really varied.

The biggest issue I have found is that I have had several parents express concern that their children are doing their homework each night but constantly forgetting to pass things in. I have a clearly designated pass in station right at the entrance of my classroom but many of my kiddos have fallen off the wagon a bit in terms of using it regularly. 


Here's what is making it complicated:

* I have a special immediately each day in the first 5 minutes after the kids arrive. So they all get in at different times from the bus in the morning and then I have to whisk them away to art or gym or whatever.

* I give verbal reminders and kids STILL don't pass things in even though they have them. I'm sick of hearing myself talk about it and I'm sure they are too.

* I don't have the time when we are back from specials to sit there and check in with every single student that they passed in homework because we have to hop right into our day since we have to squish in reading and writing in the hour and a half before lunch.

Anyways, I would really appreciate any advice anyone has on how I can kind of ""train"" the kids to get into the habit of getting their homework passed in each day without losing my mind or my voice!

Anyways, It is a miracle if I can even plan what I'm teaching more than a day in advance so I honestly have let it fall by the wayside a bit. I'm hoping to get back on track with it after break but I'm honestly not looking for a system that will require me to do a lot of serious checking of homework because I just can't put that on my to-do list this year.


The biggest issue I have found is that I have had several parents express concern that their children are doing their homework each night but constantly forgetting to pass things in. I have a clearly designated pass in station right at the entrance of my classroom but many of my kiddos have fallen off the wagon a bit in terms of using it regularly. 


Here's what is making it complicated:

* I have a special immediately each day in the first 5 minutes after the kids arrive. So they all get in at different times from the bus in the morning and then I have to whisk them away to art or gym or whatever.

* I give verbal reminders and kids STILL don't pass things in even though they have them. I'm sick of hearing myself talk about it and I'm sure they are too.

* I don't have the time when we are back from specials to sit there and check in with every single student that they passed in homework because we have to hop right into our day since we have to squish in reading and writing in the hour and a half before lunch.

Anyways, I would really appreciate any advice anyone has on how I can kind of ""train"" the kids to get into the habit of getting their homework passed in each day without losing my mind or my voice! I'm also down for changing up my system if it will make it easier and less stressful for my kiddos and me! :)",707,compound,0.9674,2018

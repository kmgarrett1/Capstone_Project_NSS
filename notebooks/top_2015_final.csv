Update: Ironically, I had a horrible, horrible day today. I just need to not let this one day bring me down!

Edit: Of course, I got the title wrong. Sorry! As a teacher, years start blurring together.


I am finishing up my 4th year of teaching. I have been rated effective and highly effective in nearly every category of teaching, and I have data to support the fact that I'm doing a good job. I wanted to start with this, not to brag, but to show you that I might not have as much experience as some, but I have gained tremendous wisdom.

I work in an extremely impoverished district in the worst state for education (New Mexico). On top of that, we have implemented PARCC and about 10 rounds of testing all year! Let's not forget the evaluations and the general craziness of being a teacher. Here is some general advice for you.

**1) Classroom management:** In my opinion, this is one of the most, if not the most important things for a teacher. If you're classroom is well-managed, you can do nearly anything! For example, I always thought I was just bad at getting students to work in groups, but that was more to with my classroom management. Classroom management literally includes every little aspect of every little thing going on in your classroom. It does not matter how old the kids are. It does not. 

*Have procedures for everything. If students start to slack on the procedures, have them practice. I have students re-enter my classroom, for instance, when they come in talking/laughing/etc.

*I can't emphasize procedures enough. What is your procedure for sharpening pencils? Walking in the hallway? Partner work? Everything? Think about it - and ingrain it from day one. If you want kids talking in your classroom, have them practice the procedure on the first day of school. 

I have motivated students in the last weeks of school. Nobody is slacking off, and I attribute this all to my classroom management system.

**2) The more you have to deal with discipline, the less your students are learning.** Have a clear system, and don't let it falter. If you say you're going to call home - call home. Make sure you are aware of your administration's policies, and design your classroom discipline system around it. Also, keep it simple. If you have to follow through with discipline on the first week of school, then do it. That first week really matters. 

**3) This is one especially for younger teachers.** You are NOT their friends and they probably don't care if you are 'cool' or not. Be a teacher. Be professional. That does not mean that you cannot connect with kids, or laugh with them, or be goofy - but you need to be seen as the adult. Don't use your age/appearance as an excuse for lack of control. Leadership goes beyond all that. I have students tell me I look 16, but they know who is in charge. 

**4) Kids are mean and your feelings will get hurt.** Don't take negative comments seriously. I was never told that kids could say some of the cruelest things. I never wanted to admit I was affected by their comments. I am not saying this happens often, but it can and will happen. 

**5) Positive Behavior Supports (PBS).** If you don't know what this is, research it. Essentially, focus on the positive, and integrate that positivity into your classroom. You will be shocked by it. 

* A student makes a rude comment or says, ""I don't want to do this!"" My response, ""Could somebody in the classroom explain how this comment in not promoting a positive environment?"" Kids hate being called out.

* Everybody is off task except for one student. ""I am looking around, and I love how almost all of the class is working hard."" The kid usually gets the point. 

* The generally naughty student is doing something right. ""Wow, Simon, thanks for cleaning up your area.""

Catch students doing something right. Save your mean voice for the serious occasions, and students will take you more seriously! Start this on day 1. ""I can't believe I have such hard workers on the first day of school! What was your name? Excellent work, Billy.""

Once you focus on PBS, you're attitude changes. It starts to become natural. I'm sure what I wrote sounds a little corny, but it really works with even my roughest kids.

**6) Listen to your instincts.** I often went against my instincts because I was told by other teachers things wouldn't work or I did not feel confident enough. When I finally started listening to what my intuition was telling me, my classroom changed. I came up with ideas I never thought would work! You will often be surrounded by a lot of negativity, but you need to be a positive force. People said I couldn't possibly get that grant money, after all. Guess they were wrong.

**7) Be honest with your students.** Teachers are human, and this may sound cliche', but students often do not see their teachers admit to their faults. When they see you as actually human, they might go easier on you. Did you mess up the test? Let them know. 

**8) There is no one right teaching style.** What works for Mrs. Davis may not work for you. You need to realize that you are unique, and while there are best practices and strategies, you have to work with your own personality. Kids can tell when you're faking it.

**9) If you are not organized, it is time to change.** You will save so much time by simply being organized. Have a place for everything in your classroom. Where do students place their bell work? Do you have an area for referrals? Where do you put work that needs to be graded? How do you keep your classroom clean and organized? You don't have to save everything. Throw out that old schedule from 2012. Give the stack of folders to the teacher who desperately needs it. 

**10) Less is often more.** You don't have to grade everything. You don't have to be involved in every committee. And you don't need to implement every element of research you learned at that convention last weekend. Find a few focus areas, and work on them. 

**11) Don't get caught up in the drama.** Other teachers may not agree with me, but I am at work to work, not to make friends. This is not to say that you can't have friends at work, but make sure that your work relationship is still professional. Collaborating with teachers is often better on a professional basis because you can be honest with each other. 

**12) Ask for help.** **Ask for help.** Believe it or not, most teachers sincerely are wiling to help you. They were all in your shoes at one point. 

**13) Learn to take criticism.** It is usually not personal. It does hurt sometimes. 

**14) Create portfolios over time.** This may not be great your first year, but after you've gained some experience, start documenting all the good you do. That way, if you need to switch jobs, districts, or whatever, you have something in it for you. You have evidence.

**15) You are't going to hear a 'thank-you' or 'good job' very often.** That can be really hard sometimes. 

**16) Limit yourself.** There is always something to do. Prioritize and have a life. Have hobbies outside of work. Don't forget to be human. 

**17) Connect with kids.** Notice things about them. Ask them questions. Show them you care. These things really matter to them. 

**18) Do not underestimate the power of parents.** Even where I work, where parent involvement is low, I still heavily rely on parents for support. Most parents are willing to work with you. There is always going to be the crazy one, but most of my experiences with parents have been positive. A good way to have a conversation with parents is ""Good bad Good."" Start with something good about the student, mention the focus areas, and end it on a positive note. This works great at parent teacher conferences, too. 

**19) Engagement is not necessarily entertainment.** It is important to engage students, but that does not mean you are a clown. Kids are going to be bored sometimes, and it is okay to be bored sometimes. You can even make a lesson out of this! We read an article in my class about how technology has taken over our lives. I challenged my students to 'be bored' for 5 minutes. They could not do anything but sit there. They loved it! They often ask to 'be bored' just to clear their minds.

Engaging can be very simple. Switch it up. Every day before I plan, I ask myself, ""What is one simple thing I could do during this lesson to switch it up?"" 

**20) You are not alone.** You may feel like you are the only teacher with specific problems, but find a community you can vent, too, like this one!

Now, of course, different teachers may have different advice, but that is what the comments are for. If these things sound logical to most of you, I apologize, but honestly, I learned most of them with experience. 


Edit I thought of another one:

**Controlled Chaos** It's okay if your room gets noisy or a little crazy. But, can you, as the teacher, bring the students back together? What's your signal for students to listen to you at any point? I say, ""Give me 5"" and students put five fingers up, must get quiet, and face whatever direction of the room I'm in and listen!


**Transitions** Have students transition from one activity to another.
For example, bell work 5 minutes. Mini grammar lesson with whiteboards 15 minutes. Reading selection and think pair share. 20 minutes. Breaks are okay, too, even if they are just 1 minute.

**My first year of teaching was the worst year of my entire life.** I needed it. I am not going to let it define me. Yes, I cried all the time and made every mistake.

I work in an extremely impoverished district in the worst state for education (New Mexico). On top of that, we have implemented PARCC and about 10 rounds of testing all year! Let's not forget the evaluations and the general craziness of being a teacher. Here is some general advice for you.

**1) Classroom management:** In my opinion, this is one of the most, if not the most important things for a teacher. If you're classroom is well-managed, you can do nearly anything! For example, I always thought I was just bad at getting students to work in groups, but that was more to with my classroom management. Classroom management literally includes every little aspect of every little thing going on in your classroom. It does not matter how old the kids are. It does not. 

*Have procedures for everything. If students start to slack on the procedures, have them practice. I have students re-enter my classroom, for instance, when they come in talking/laughing/etc.

*I can't emphasize procedures enough. What is your procedure for sharpening pencils? Walking in the hallway? Partner work? Everything? Think about it - and ingrain it from day one. If you want kids talking in your classroom, have them practice the procedure on the first day of school. 

I have motivated students in the last weeks of school. Nobody is slacking off, and I attribute this all to my classroom management system.

**2) The more you have to deal with discipline, the less your students are learning.** Have a clear system, and don't let it falter. If you say you're going to call home - call home. Make sure you are aware of your administration's policies, and design your classroom discipline system around it. Also, keep it simple. If you have to follow through with discipline on the first week of school, then do it. That first week really matters. 

**3) This is one especially for younger teachers.** You are NOT their friends and they probably don't care if you are 'cool' or not. Be a teacher. Be professional. That does not mean that you cannot connect with kids, or laugh with them, or be goofy - but you need to be seen as the adult. Don't use your age/appearance as an excuse for lack of control. Leadership goes beyond all that. I have students tell me I look 16, but they know who is in charge. 

**4) Kids are mean and your feelings will get hurt.** Don't take negative comments seriously. I was never told that kids could say some of the cruelest things. I never wanted to admit I was affected by their comments. I am not saying this happens often, but it can and will happen. 

**5) Positive Behavior Supports (PBS).** If you don't know what this is, research it. Essentially, focus on the positive, and integrate that positivity into your classroom. You will be shocked by it. 

* A student makes a rude comment or says, ""I don't want to do this!"" My response, ""Could somebody in the classroom explain how this comment in not promoting a positive environment?"" Kids hate being called out.

* Everybody is off task except for one student. ""I am looking around, and I love how almost all of the class is working hard."" The kid usually gets the point. 

* The generally naughty student is doing something right. ""Wow, Simon, thanks for cleaning up your area.""

Catch students doing something right. Save your mean voice for the serious occasions, and students will take you more seriously! Start this on day 1. ""I can't believe I have such hard workers on the first day of school! What was your name? Excellent work, Billy.""

Once you focus on PBS, you're attitude changes. It starts to become natural. I'm sure what I wrote sounds a little corny, but it really works with even my roughest kids.

**6) Listen to your instincts.** I often went against my instincts because I was told by other teachers things wouldn't work or I did not feel confident enough. When I finally started listening to what my intuition was telling me, my classroom changed. I came up with ideas I never thought would work! You will often be surrounded by a lot of negativity, but you need to be a positive force. People said I couldn't possibly get that grant money, after all. Guess they were wrong.

**7) Be honest with your students.** Teachers are human, and this may sound cliche', but students often do not see their teachers admit to their faults. When they see you as actually human, they might go easier on you. Did you mess up the test? Let them know. 

**8) There is no one right teaching style.** What works for Mrs. Davis may not work for you. You need to realize that you are unique, and while there are best practices and strategies, you have to work with your own personality. Kids can tell when you're faking it.

**9) If you are not organized, it is time to change.** You will save so much time by simply being organized. Have a place for everything in your classroom. Where do students place their bell work? Do you have an area for referrals? Where do you put work that needs to be graded? How do you keep your classroom clean and organized? You don't have to save everything. Throw out that old schedule from 2012. Give the stack of folders to the teacher who desperately needs it. 

**10) Less is often more.** You don't have to grade everything. You don't have to be involved in every committee. And you don't need to implement every element of research you learned at that convention last weekend. Find a few focus areas, and work on them. 

**11) Don't get caught up in the drama.** Other teachers may not agree with me, but I am at work to work, not to make friends. This is not to say that you can't have friends at work, but make sure that your work relationship is still professional. Collaborating with teachers is often better on a professional basis because you can be honest with each other. 

**12) Ask for help.** **Ask for help.** Believe it or not, most teachers sincerely are wiling to help you. They were all in your shoes at one point. 

**13) Learn to take criticism.** It is usually not personal. It does hurt sometimes. 

**14) Create portfolios over time.** This may not be great your first year, but after you've gained some experience, start documenting all the good you do. That way, if you need to switch jobs, districts, or whatever, you have something in it for you. You have evidence.

**15) You are't going to hear a 'thank-you' or 'good job' very often.** That can be really hard sometimes. 

**16) Limit yourself.** There is always something to do. Prioritize and have a life. Have hobbies outside of work. Don't forget to be human. 

**17) Connect with kids.** Notice things about them. Ask them questions. Show them you care. These things really matter to them. 

**18) Do not underestimate the power of parents.** Even where I work, where parent involvement is low, I still heavily rely on parents for support. Most parents are willing to work with you. There is always going to be the crazy one, but most of my experiences with parents have been positive. A good way to have a conversation with parents is ""Good bad Good."" Start with something good about the student, mention the focus areas, and end it on a positive note. This works great at parent teacher conferences, too. 

**19) Engagement is not necessarily entertainment.** It is important to engage students, but that does not mean you are a clown. Kids are going to be bored sometimes, and it is okay to be bored sometimes. You can even make a lesson out of this! We read an article in my class about how technology has taken over our lives. I challenged my students to 'be bored' for 5 minutes. They could not do anything but sit there. They loved it! They often ask to 'be bored' just to clear their minds.

Engaging can be very simple. Switch it up. Every day before I plan, I ask myself, ""What is one simple thing I could do during this lesson to switch it up?"" 

**20) You are not alone.** You may feel like you are the only teacher with specific problems, but find a community you can vent, too, like this one!

Now, of course, different teachers may have different advice, but that is what the comments are for. If these things sound logical to most of you, I apologize, but honestly, I learned most of them with experience. 


Edit I thought of another one:

**Controlled Chaos** It's okay if your room gets noisy or a little crazy. But, can you, as the teacher, bring the students back together? What's your signal for students to listen to you at any point? I say, ""Give me 5"" and students put five fingers up, must get quiet, and face whatever direction of the room I'm in and listen!


**Transitions** Have students transition from one activity to another.
For example, bell work 5 minutes. Mini grammar lesson with whiteboards 15 minutes. Reading selection and think pair share. 20 minutes. Breaks are okay, too, even if they are just 1 minute.

**My first year of teaching was the worst year of my entire life.** I needed it. I am not going to let it define me. Yes, I cried all the time and made every mistake.

Edit again: I'm on my way to a field trip and this post was gilded. Let's just say I'm having a great day. Thanks for the gold :D",24,compound,0.998,2015

What I do know is that my principal asked me (teacher) to sit in on an interview panel to drill a bunch of candidates for a position in my department, and it was painful. So painful. I work at the top district in my state, our pay is 30% higher than our neighboring urban district, our demographic is wealthy and college-bound, and our schools are nationally ranked. A job at this district is like the Holy Grail of teaching gigs, and we get tons of applications for every job posting. District does the paper screening and the interview panel gets the best of the bunch.

So I was shocked at the quality of candidates that came through the door. It was so exhausting and frustrating and after we finished, I thought I should post on the sub because maybe some of the thoughts we shared behind closed doors could help job seekers currently in the market.

Getting hired at the right school is brutal and the hardest part is getting an interview. Once you have a face-to-face, please practice and do your best to prep. You'll be surprised at how many people do not, so just looking like you have your shit together gives you an upper hand. 

1. *Answer the question, PLEASE*: The ramblers were the worst. They went on and on and on and my principal didn't want to be rude and cut them off. Usually a long answer demonstrated a lack of focus and direction, and perhaps nerves. Give a succinct, clear answer and supply max 2 examples. Don't contradict yourself, don't let your words get away from you and don't try to share some grand complex vision. You don't have time and you won't impress the audience. Because as my principal said, 'if they can't keep our attention for 5 minutes at a time, how will they deal with a room full of kids for an hour and a half?'

2. *We react to your body language*: Smile. Give off good vibes. We (interviewers) are stuck in a small room for four hours+ and we already gone through 6 people before you. Some energy and positivity is so appreciated and helps your cause. It also gives us a glimpse on what kind of teacher you'd be. It's all about the presentation and even if you're not in front of a white board, work the crowd as if you were (in the best way possible, that is).

3. *Bring student work or demo lessons*: Only two candidates did this and they ended up our top two picks. Having examples of your hard work and something tactile to back up your words makes a huge difference. Could be an essay, a worksheet you created or a video of students. It makes you seem prepared, organized and that you can back up your answers.

4. *Don't ask about salary, that info is online*: Don't waste that 'so do you have any questions for us' question on salary. Or calendar dates. Figure this out. I'd say most districts have that information online so you can do your research. Also don't use this time to explain you have a vacation scheduled right before school starts so you need the first two days off. You don't have the job yet so don't act like it.

5. *Know the basics*: We're not going to ask you U of Chicago style free response questions ex. If you were a succulent which type would you be and potato? You have your greatest hits: background, teaching philosophy, classroom management, differentiation, parent involvement, PLC, common core, some examples of a good lesson or problem solving, etc. There are lists online so practice those at home. Most of our candidates were nervous yet stunned when we asked them something like, ""how would you build relationships with your students and foster positive classroom culture?"" Deer in headlights. Kind of sad.

6. *Don't dig yourself into a hole*: Start strong. Attack the first question with vigor and try hard to get the ball rolling in a good direction. Positivity positivity. Candidates that stumbled the first couple questions had to struggle to make up the difference, and by that time most of the panel had already made up their mind. 

7. *Remain positive, and don't diss anyone*: Oof. The worsts were the people who slammed other teachers, students, parents, administrators. No one wants that kind of toxic attitude in the staff room. This isn't the daily lunch gripe so don't act like it is. Act like you, gasp, love teaching!

8. *Read over what you wrote on your application*: Some apps essay responses and when we asked people about their answers, many looked 100% clueless. It's as if they didn't write the answers themselves.

I'm fabricating these post titles, but any subscriber to this sub for the past month recognizes a trend among first-year teacher postings. Some first-year teachers are treading water right now - surviving, if not thriving. Many more are stressed, panicked, scared. *Teacher training felt so much different!* many seem to think. *I didn't know it would be like this. How soon can I resign?* 

I've got some news for you, first years, as a ""seasoned"" veteran (on year 5, so take that with a grain of salt): 

This. Is. Totally. Normal.  In fact, what you're going through has been [documented by professionals:] (http://www.newteachercenter.org/blog/phases-first-year-teaching) If you follow the ""normal"" progression of first-year teaching, you're going to slump until Christmas, and have some dark nights of the soul. *But just knowing that's going to happen - knowing that it's normal - can help you!*

Teaching is a profession with a steep learning curve like no other. You're experiencing something called 'decision fatigue': even if you are making the RIGHT instructional choices, you are literally making **thousands of micro-decisions a day that you have never been asked to make before**. Can Johnny go to the bathroom? How about Shirley, who you know is bored and doesn't really have to pee? How will you differentiate for the 12 kids with IEPs in your class of 35+? What will you do when the kids defy your seating chart? Figure out you're a first-year? When the principal walks in? When someone sets something on fire? 

These are all decisions that you are capable of handling. But the point is, you haven't had to negotiate them yet. So you're stressed.  And as any veteran here can tell you: 

*It will get better*. 

Some advice: 

* **Don't re-invent the wheel.** You may have been told this nominates you for Worst Teacher of the Year, but it's OK to assign questions from the textbook sometimes. Whatever you think of TeachersPayTeachers, pay $5 for a worksheet or two when it's 2AM and you're spinning your wheels. The world will not end. The content you are teaching is NOT new.  Other people have systems about how to teach it. Before you make up your own system, focus on delivering it smoothly first. 
* **Relationships first.** Your behavior plans may change throughout the year as you find a system that works for you. But kids aren't going to follow you unless they like you on some level. Chat with kids in the hallway, go to their football games, whatever. But before content, you have to get them on your side. 
* **Schedule ONE night - at least one a week - that is just for YOU.** Take a pottery class, Crossfit, go to the bar, whatever. Make this day sacred. You will be a better, more human person and teacher for it. 
* **There is always more to do. ALWAYS. Prioritize.** Before you leave the building that day, ask yourself, ""What are the 3-5 most important things I need to do?"" Do those. The rest can get done tomorrow. 
* **Use your resources.** Your mentor teacher? Hit them up. It's literally their job to get you better. Your mentor sucks? That's why we're here. Go to a conference this year and vow to try something you see. Teaching is a community profession. We're a village. What you've gone through, 100 other teachers have faced too. You won't make it if you're an island. 

I remember where you guys were, and I almost quit. My first year teaching, I thought I was going to die. I puked/had diarrhea every morning. I thought the kids hated me. I thought I wasn't cut out for this, and Googled ""How to quit teaching"" every night. I actually fell into a literal depression, and needed to medicate with Zoloft + therapy (which was life-saving. Take care of yourself!!!!)

And then... sometime after Christmas.... it just started to get better. I started to figure shit out. The decisions weren't so new anymore. I started to really focus on the kids. Things just started to *click.* 

This will happen to you, too, if you work at it and believe in this process and understand that this is normal.

Trust.

* **There is always more to do. ALWAYS. Prioritize.** Before you leave the building that day, ask yourself, ""What are the 3-5 most important things I need to do?"" Do those. The rest can get done tomorrow. 
* **Use your resources.** Your mentor teacher? Hit them up. It's literally their job to get you better. Your mentor sucks? That's why we're here. Go to a conference this year and vow to try something you see. Teaching is a community profession. We're a village. What you've gone through, 100 other teachers have faced too. You won't make it if you're an island. 

I remember where you guys were, and I almost quit. My first year teaching, I thought I was going to die. I puked/had diarrhea every morning. I thought the kids hated me. I thought I wasn't cut out for this, and Googled ""How to quit teaching"" every night. I actually fell into a literal depression, and needed to medicate with Zoloft + therapy (which was life-saving. Take care of yourself!!!!)

And then... sometime after Christmas.... it just started to get better. I started to figure shit out. The decisions weren't so new anymore. I started to really focus on the kids. Things just started to *click.* 

This will happen to you, too, if you work at it and believe in this process and understand that this is normal.

Trust. 
 
You can do this!

I was frustrated, stressed, and really didn't think I'd pass (my cooperating teacher actually had to take a class back over because I had ""lost control"" of it). 

I continued making changes, trying to be an effective teacher. Some time after Spring break things start clicking and coming together. I got more confident and comfortable. Things started taking less time, etc. 

I can say I'm very proud to have finished. I've learned a lot and think I will really enjoy this profession. Not being spoon-fed by mentor teacher is going to make a world of difference when I do get my own class. It was a struggle going through it, but I've come out unscathed, a better person/ diplomat, and a real life teacher.

Thanks for all the support from this community, ladies and gents! I'm not going anywhere and will be around here for awhile. 

For those of you starting student teaching: Just keeping making steps, no matter how small, towards your goal. You'll get there. :)",47,compound,0.9444,2015

I've been doing a lot of reflecting about an assembly that my school had early this week about our dress code, and I'd like to have a discussion with some fellow teachers about what I observed. 

For reference, I work in a very small rural school in the Midwest. In general, my co-workers are middle aged or older, and all but two have been teaching in my district for 15-20+ years. The mindset in my school is generally very conservative, and I tend to be the odd-man-out in a lot of discussions because I'm a new, young teacher. My views are sometimes seen as too progressive, ""liberal"" or idealistic. I'm not offended by their opinions about me; I just want to open this discussion up to a larger audience. 

My school, same as every other school I've been in and attended, frames their discussions (or, rather, lectures) about dress code around words like ""self-respect"" and ""distraction"". I can't help but notice that every student who gets in trouble for dress code violations is female. Granted, we don't have an issue with sagging pants at our school, so there's less opportunity for our gentlemen to break the dress code. 

That being said, *knowing* that the dress code is essentially targeted at the young women in our school, I find it upsetting that every time an administrator talks to our students about the dress code, the conversation always comes back to not showing your bra straps or not wearing shorts that are too short because it shows that you ""have self-respect"". I'm not arguing that they should be able to wear whatever they want; I hate seeing those short shorts as much as anyone else, but it upsets me that the conversation boils down to telling our young women that their self-worth and ability to be respected comes down to what they wear. No girl puts on short shorts because they see themselves as a slut or as trashy; they do it because they think they look cute and, let's be honest, all stores with teen clothing sell short shorts almost exclusively. When was the last time you saw a bermuda short for women in American Eagle? 

More upsetting still is our tendency to say that the dress code is to ""prevent distractions"". When it's only young women who are policed on dress code, it's implying that it is their job to cover themselves vs. the young men's jobs not to ogle their classmates. That's problematic, and upsets me more than the ""self respect"" conversation. Most of these kids wear clothes that aren't school appropriate when they hang out with their friends; it's not like the first time a 9th grader sees an errant bra strap will be in school when someone wears a spaghetti strap shirt. I would love to see all language referring to dress code infractions as ""distracting"" removed from school handbooks. 

I think a much more appropriate angle would be to communicate that school is like their job, and students are expected to adhere to the dress code because they need to present themselves in a professional way. Every job has a dress code; if I showed up to school in a stained T-shirt and sweatpants, would anyone see me as an authority figure? What if restaurants had no dress code for their employees-- that would cause confusion. What if someone showed up to a farming job in inappropriate work attire, like open-toed shoes? Adhering to the dress expectations of your boss is a true life skill that they will have to practice until they retire; why not discuss dress code this way?

Sorry that this turned into a rant. I'm just trying to work through my personal conflict: I *don't* think that girls should come to school in super-short shorts or spaghetti straps, nor should boys come with sagging pants or inappropriate t-shirts, but I don't like the way we communicate those expectations to our students.

Many of you are first year teachers being thrown into environments where classroom management is your number 1 concern. This thread is where I'll share what I've learned in the past 4 short years and open it up to discussion. It will be broken down into two parts. Part 1 is about things that make you an effective manage and part 2 is about how you would/should handle different situations.

**Part 1 - Being a good manager**

1. Be the captain of your own ship. Good leaders need to give everyone under their care a voice while maintaining control. Teenagers are master manipulators. They will say and do whatever they feel like they need to in order to get their way. You  need to be the adult in charge of that classroom. Teenagers can smell the ""pushover vibe"". Be overly assertive at first. Shut down any attempts by students to buck responsibility for their actions (be it behavior or academic). Make that message of personal responsibility clear from second 1 and don't let up. They'll thank you by the end of the year.
2. Be consistent. Did you make Jake take off his hat? Well, better make Molly take hers off too. All people *everywhere* hate it when you play favorites. From day 1 let it be known that the rules are in place for everyone. If you feel like you should be treated specially, that's wonderful, but it won't happen in this room.
3. Be firm and even more consistent. Don't give warnings for obvious breaches of school policy. If a student blatantly disregards school or class policy (answers the phone in the middle of class, inappropriately touches another student, yells at another student, etc) give an immediate consequence. I prefer to make the delivery of consequences public. Take the phone or call security and have it taken (whatever is appropriate for your school). I tell them there's no shame in messing up, but there's plenty of shame in hiding it. You are there to maximize the educational outcome for every student in the classroom. Letting one yahoo screw around on his phone while everyone else works hurts every student (some students are distracted by the behavior, that one student is obviously distracted, and it's totally inappropriate for the learning environment).
4. Talk to your problem students. Some of my problem kids are spoiled rotten. They've got 6 Fs and their parents buy them everything they could ever want (a new phone twice a year, new shoes once a month, $50 per week allowance, etc) and don't understand that this shit isn't going to get them anywhere once they leave high school in a year or two. Others are different. They're foster kids who lack real adult figure in their lives. Some have parents who work until 9 at night 7 days a week. Some kids are un-reachable. Many are just amazed that you're interested in their lives. **TALK TO YOUR PROBLEM STUDENTS. DON'T BE DICKS TO THEM**. Yes, their behavior is totally inappropriate, but if you're able to build a relationship with them, you're likely to start a hugely positive change in them. I've seen it happen plenty of times.
5. **DO NOT let students talk while you're talking**. Seriously. It's disrespectful, it's inappropriate, and it's bad for learning. So many new teachers will continue on if just a few kids are quietly talking. My rule is, ""if everyone can't be doing it, no-one can be doing it"". It's fair, I'm consistent with it, and it makes sense with the kids. People like learning, sometimes they just need to be made aware of it. Don't give them an excuse to not pay attention.

**Part 2 - what would you do if...**

A. You're doing some explicit direct instruction with some complicated shit. You've got two students to your left quietly talking, one student to your right on her phone, and two students in the back row talking to each other. You notice all these things with 10 seconds of each other. How do you handle the situation?

B. You have a student with a high F in your class. She doesn't take notes or actively participate in activities in class. You get confronted by this parent on Back to School Night. The parent says her daughter has never earned anything less than a C in a class and that YOU must be screwing up. They stand there waiting for your response...Well?

C. You see a student on their phone during a test. How do you approach the student? What do you say? What are your next steps?

D. You ask a student to stop talking to his neighbor while another student is talking. He says he wasn't talking (even though he clearly was) and calls you a fucking asshole. How do you proceed?

Please post your own scenarios and helpful tricks for classroom management. Each year it seems like new teachers ask the same questions and get the same answers. It might be helpful to have one thread where many experienced and new teachers chime in on the subject to refer people to in the future.

For example:

* If there is a curriculum with pre-made lesson plans and/or materials, you might as well disregard them because they are almost always poorly done and you would be deemed ""ineffective"" using those lessons.

I've been teaching full time for 3 years, this is my 4th year, and it's by far my best start yet!    
  
I am the reading specialist in my school.  My year starts *very* different than classroom teachers.  To actually start teaching I have to assess all students who are below or at risk of being below in reading, then meet with all their teachers,  only after that can I make definitive groups, and finally make my *extremely* complicated schedule.    
  
Currently I'm in the middle of meeting with teachers and confirming my groupings.  I bring this up because it exemplifies why I love my job. I get the chance to talk in depth with every teacher about their students.  My job is SO awesome because I get to share student successes with other teachers.    
  
When I was a classroom teacher, I always felt alone.  Me and my kids were on an island.  When they succeeded, we celebrated of course.  But the only way I could share in that happiness with another professional was to explain what happened.  My teacher colleagues would always say ""good job"" or ""that's awesome"" or something like that, but truth be told they weren't invested in my kids.  
  
As a reading specialist, all of the kids I service are also taught by another teacher.  We share their successes and tribulations.  I get to have seriously in-depth and specific conversations about student progress, data analysis, interventions, etc.  It's the BEST!   
  
I wish, with all my heart, that the educational doubters out there could be a fly on the wall in my reading lab this week.  They would witness for themselves the high level of expertise and professionalism teachers bring to the table everyday.  
  
I love my job. I love it so much because I get to work with experts in child development and education.  I love it because I get to have open discourse with fellow professionals about helping kids learn.

I came to /r/Teachers for help when I was feeling desperately burned out and needed advice.

I've since deleted my old Reddit account and started a new one, as my old Reddit name was so close to my real name, I wanted to protect my anonymity. That's why you won't find the old post in my user history.

Everyone here was so nice, empathetic, and helpful. You gave me tons of upvotes, comments, and love when I needed it most. Thank you. 

I made the difficult decision to quit on Halloween. I taught for exactly 10 weeks. I had to get a note from my doctor explaining that I was mentally unfit for the teaching profession because my superintendent and principal threatened to sue me for breaking contract.

I cannot thank this community enough for the help they gave me during that time in my life.

I thought the community might want to know how things turned out, so I'll tell you the good and the bad:

1. The Bad

I felt a little guilty about quitting on short notice. 

I hated leaving the good, motivated kids without a teacher.

I had assumed since we have a large college in town with an education program, the school would find a December graduate to take my place and the kids would be better off with a more qualified, prepared teacher. 

In reality, the 2 teachers they hired after me quit very quickly. They ended up with basically a babysitter who didn't require attendance, so I was sad about that. I didn't regret my decision to leave, but I felt sad for the kids who wanted to learn.

I still can't listen to the songs my choir performed for their concert. It makes me too anxious and takes me back to the horrible days of kids walking out of my class, being disrespectful, and feelings of helplessness.  

For months after I quit, I would wake up in the morning feeling a deep sense of shame that I couldn't control my classroom. I used a crisis hotline a few times and that really helped.

Now for...

2. The Good

I immediately got a job answering phones at a theater. The pay was low, but so was the stress, and I enjoyed a job where I didn't take work home. I had a fantastic boss who was very nice to me. I felt like I was on vacation much of the time.

Most importantly, I discovered that I love being a receptionist! After 6 months, I took a higher-paying temp job doing more receptionist work, and that was great, too. I even got to go to a fundraiser with Mary Steenburgen and Bill Clinton.

Last month, I got an offer from an organization I've been trying to get into for 3 years. The pay is adequate to cover all my bills, the org pays 100% of my health, dental, and vision insurance, and I even have some leftover every month to put in savings. 

It's still a stressful job in a way. Our clientele is mostly the bottom 10% of society in terms of behavior, so I see grown people throw fits every day, but my boss has my back and always steps in when I need help. I am never alone and we help each other out as a team. 

The job is a good fit for me. I'm naturally very smiley, nice, and friendly, and while those characteristics were drawbacks in the world of high school classroom management, they make me an excellent receptionist.

Last October, I was a fish who was devastated that I couldn't climb a tree. Now I have found my way to the river where I belong. And it feels good.

It also says 40% of kids are ready for college. 

2. Student loan debt is out of control. With 40% ready, remediation is soaking up the debt. So essentially, kids are paying for high school.

Kids aren't finishing and taking on debt. So colleges are paying for a bottom end that never finishes. They're paying for FTEs that should not exist. 

4. So what?  Kids are paying for not taking shit seriously. That would be true if information wasn't asymmetrical. Kids depend on us to give them the straight dope. If we push them along, what signal does that send?

5. K-12 isn't equipped to deal with the bottleneck. How is that their fault?  For all of the reasons above we should work harder. Have kids take college courses in high school so we can promote the 40%. Give it to them at community college prices.

We talked about how when one of our friends says something unkind, uses their hands or feet to hurt, or says you can’t play, our heart wrinkles a little. I demonstrated by wrinkling the large heart.

By the end of the book, our heart was a wrinkled, crumpled mess. Then, each child had the opportunity to try to “fix it.” One at a time, the children came up, said sorry, and tried to smooth out the heart.

I didn't mean for it to be venting, though some may occur, rather I meant it as a cautionary tale. 

I'm leaving teaching. For good. I don't find it fulfilling; I feel bullied by administration, disrespected by the kids, and like everything I do is an exercise in futility. Going to work every day is a chore, and once when I almost got hit by an 18-wheeler on the highway my first thought was ""Huh, if that hit, I'd have a good excuse not to go in today."" That is not the kind of mentality that one should have as a teacher. 

From what I've seen, the system is so broken, kids are so apathetic, and administration is so clueless that there's little point to even having schools if this is the way America is going to run them. And I don't feel like a terrible person for saying it: we're failing these kids and there's nothing we can do about it. 

So, probably after I speak to my family in the morning and get some things squared away, I'm going to tender my resignation on Monday. I took two sick days in order to get my head on straight and found that not being in that school was the happiest I'd been in months. I have enough money to get me through March (I hope) and if I drop the job now I can turn my full attention to getting a new job and stop wasting the kid's time as well as my own. 

The profession broke me. I no longer have any desire to be a teacher, or even have children of my own seeing what a sorry state the education system is in. I feel like somewhat of a failure, but at least was able to succeed in finding that this world was not for me. 

To those of you that found success and joy in teaching, I commend you and applaud you, but I do not pretend to understand you. The toil you go through, that we went through, is a weight too much to bear, for me at least. 

To those of you starting out I wish you the best of luck and hope that your experience in the field is far superior to mine. 

Also, those of you looking for work, don't jump at the first job you get offered. That was my mistake. Research it fully, see if entire teams of teachers quit at once and left for another school and that's why there's a job opening for you there, for example. Look into the support they offer teachers (if any at all). And ask LOTS of questions. Just take everything you're told with a grain of salt. 

Lastly, I would like to thank this subreddit for all the advice, help, and shoulders that I was able to cry on during this journey. At a time of great upheaval you were a beacon to guide my path and allow me to keep from careening off track so badly that I burned out in November instead of now.

I didn't mean for it to be venting, though some may occur, rather I meant it as a cautionary tale. 

I'm leaving teaching. For good. I don't find it fulfilling; I feel bullied by administration, disrespected by the kids, and like everything I do is an exercise in futility. Going to work every day is a chore, and once when I almost got hit by an 18-wheeler on the highway my first thought was ""Huh, if that hit, I'd have a good excuse not to go in today."" That is not the kind of mentality that one should have as a teacher. 

From what I've seen, the system is so broken, kids are so apathetic, and administration is so clueless that there's little point to even having schools if this is the way America is going to run them. And I don't feel like a terrible person for saying it: we're failing these kids and there's nothing we can do about it. 

So, probably after I speak to my family in the morning and get some things squared away, I'm going to tender my resignation on Monday. I took two sick days in order to get my head on straight and found that not being in that school was the happiest I'd been in months.

And the kids that didn't get on the honor roll are now eager to make it next time. It was so awesome to watch. 

And it has shown in work effort too - I keep joking that  my kids have been replaced with pod people but its amazing.

A few people on here have openly chastised me for comments I've made about my school district, going so far as to suggest I find a new vocation. For those of you in my situation of teaching -subbing rather- in an extremely dysfunctional district, please allow me a rant. 
Today I was a victim of sexual harassment -assault if you want to get technical- and I am so filled with rage I can barely write it out. 
I was standing when a girl ran up to me, straddled my thigh, and began rubbing her crotch on me. I immediately reeled on her and yelled at her, telling her it's sexual harassment, that you don't just rub your genitalia on people, and she walked off. My AP was walking down the hallway as this occurred, and I flagged down a security guard to get the girl to bring to the office. There was no way I was going to let this piece of shit stay in the classroom for the period. The AP heard me explaining what happened and the girl who did it ran up to her, did almost the same thing (no physical contact though) and said basically ""that's all I did."" She was told that her actions were inappropriate and both went on their way. I'm fairly certain she just remained in the hallways for the remainder of the period as it wasn't until the following period that I gave a written report of it to another AP and the absolute end of the day when he asked for a recounting of what happened. 

I'm so angry and so disgusted by this. I'm annoyed that other teachers respond with a ""yeah, that happens"" type of attitude or worse a ""well, she's the lesbian one so..."" As a lesbian I am disgusted that this is even brought up as an explanation. It's not what we fucking do and anyone saying ""well she *is* gay"" immediately puts me in a position where my own victimization is being used as a tool to discriminate against gays and lesbians.

I don't ever want to have this stupid kid in a class that I am covering and I know that this is unrealistic to ask for. I'm angered by the violation and I am infuriated that this is what I have to put up with bc I am only a sub. I can't choose to not work in this district bc if I don't work here I cannot pay my bills (basically all I can afford to do is pay my mortgage, utilities, and groceries -this, for only 8 months out of the year and then for 4 months I'm left scrambling and borrowing).

Today I subbed as a PE teacher. A first for me. The gym, where they often have class, was off limits, so I had to do gym in the hallway. A very long hallway.

It was fucking chaos, no one listened, kids were fighting, I couldn't control it, I lost my voice, I lost my energy, and I went to get help from the office.

When I went to the office, the Assistant Principal saw me and told me to come into her office. I just started crying. I had my head in my hands facing the floor and I could see really big drops of water just continually hitting the floor. 

I have never cried as a substitute before (in fact last week I enjoyed the co-teaching position a lot at a different school), but today I fucking lost it. 

I suspect I could lose my job as I elected to go home instead of finishing up the day, and the temp agency I work for may have a problem with that.


Here's what scares me....

Is this an indication of me hating teaching? Subbing really seems like the worst aspects of teaching all crammed into one shitty long exhausting under prepared day, and I don't want to believe teaching will be like that, but on days like this, I am at a breaking point and terrified.

I want to teach high school and I've had great experiences with teenagers, but I do see I've got little experience with classroom management (at least with elementary in this subbing scenario) and at times I truly do not know what else to do to get the kids to listen. 

What the fuck do I do to make a living while I'm still in school? And does it get better? I'm not even sure what I'm looking for here, but I just spent the last 20 minutes on the google search ""Subbing is not like being a teacher"" followed by ""subbing sucks.""

Here are some constructive ways to reduce the number of copies you use in the classroom. These are very simple solutions that will save you time, save you copies, and may put you at risk for being a better teacher. Use with caution. Your mileage may vary. I use the below tactics with all of my classes, including my freshman science course with 35 kids and up to my Honors/AP seniors. These work. Seriously.

1) Unless there is an IEP, never print notes. Writing is a learning and thinking exercise that is kinesthetically connected to the content. If you are printing notes for kids and they do not engage physically with the content, then you are missing out on a valuable teaching tool at this very basic, fundamental level. If you still must print content for the students, keep reading below. There are good hints for how to minimize the number of prints you have to make. But in general, never print something that kids can learn from by writing it themselves.

2) Related to this, do not allow students to write on worksheets unless there is an IEP. I tell my students to use worksheets as if they were a questions in the textbook. I make my students write answers on their own paper in a way that the reader can tell what the question was asked. So no matter what format I presented content in, the kids will always produce handwritten content that they have connected with that is of study value. By allowing kids to simply fill in blanks and circle multiple-choices, we rob them of the thought time invested in writing the content. We also make it simpler for them to copy and cheat their way through. Sure they can still copy someone else's sentences, but you still make it a learning exercise in the sense that they spent time thinking about those sentences during the time they had to write them. Pick your fights wisely.

3) Print copy only for those who cannot access via their smartphone etc. Make notes/worksheets available online. I promise you this is not complicated. I can show you how to share a single folder in 2 minutes, and then take 30 seconds to make that available to all your kids forever for the rest of the year. After that two-and-a-half minutes, you'll never need to spend that time again. Extremely low maintenance. Find out who can access the internet from their phone or homes, and who cannot. 

4) Print two pages per sheet and in landscape mode (paper sideways). The kids can read an amazingly small print. If it is the same page over and over again, your sheets will have the same page twice on them. Cut the sheets in half and you have double the prints that you can hand out. With this trick alone you will save half of your prints.

5) Make them share copies with a partner. One successful way to do this is to print one sheet that has two pages on a single side (landscape mode print, ""multiple pages per sheet"" mode, 2x1). Cut the page in half, make two students share each half. You just printed one copy and served four students. This method will reduce your printing by 75%.

6) Do not make copies into personal possession items. This is a classroom culture thing. Your copies are classroom resources, not candy to mass copy and provide 13 each to students who never do the work and always blame forgetting their work and then blame you because you didn't print enough. Silence that noise and end the entitlement culture. Copies belong to the classroom and may be viewed/borrowed/used as necessary. They are not party favors.

I hope these pro-tips help someone. The practices have been part of my personal classroom culture transformation that I've never regretted. You can use any of these individually but they all work very well together with greater effect. If there is something about these ideas you want to ask or discuss or even improve, please comment. Teach me something cool too!

I want to leave NOW, but that would be a huge waste of the time and effort I have put into the program since I am almost done. 

The #1 reason why this job is so difficult is the lack of support from the principal (admin in general); the principal did not know what I was teaching, who i was teaching until the 1st day of school! No books, no curriculum, not enough desks, no paper, no working copy machine....It is a nightmare. The principal and APs routinely shame the teachers and tell us that we have it good compared to some of the other schools out there. We are threatened to answer the surveys certain way so the school doesn't look bad. Just today, one of the APs came into my room and yelled at me in front of my students (because he thought that I had done something wrong...but he was wrong. he later apologized). 

Anyway, thanks for all the support. Hopefully I can come back with a good update. 

Original Post: 



I plan to find a non-teaching job (but hopefully still in education/non-profit) after finishing up this year. 

I teach in an extremely underserved area -- I fear for my safety daily. 

The only thing is...as I teach this year, I am feelings like such a fraud; my kids ask me, ""Miss, can I take your elective next year?"" ""Miss, are we going to have you in 11th grade year?"" I say yes to these type of question...while thinking about -- dreaming about -- leaving. 

I honestly LOVE teaching and working with teens, but I just cannot deal with the stress anymore. Even this morning, I was cursed at by a random kid from another school as I was entering the school building. My kids are great, but there's 35 of them squeezed into a classroom (and I teach 5 periods). Ihave gained 15 lbs from the stress, my immune system is failing (allergy, eczema, constantly sick), and I simply do not have the will do do this. 

My boyfriend tells me to quit now, but I just cannot do it. I will finish this year, but  do I tell the students that I won't be coming back next year? Do I just keep saying yes when kids ask me if I will be doing xyz with them next year? I feel so sad because I know I will miss my kids...

Phone was stolen today by a student. We know who did it but the phone is gone. Questions about recourse.10th grade English teacher here. I don't want to give away too many details so I'll get straight to the point.

As soon as I realized the phone was gone I put the room on lock down. No one left. Called an admin who called school police. Then a student came back from the bathroom. I didn't put the pieces together at the time but after they searched every student and came up empty we went to the bathroom and found my empty phone case. 

The phone is gone. Phone company wiped it. (didn't have the tracker app :(

What can I do? Everyone knows who did it. One student in the class, who won't come forward, admitted she saw him take it. Students outside of my class confirmed it not 30 minutes afterward.

This is based entirely on my own experience, so feel free to add how things are different in your state or district. A little background about myself: I have taught in both American schools overseas and schools in the United States. This past year I was treated for cancer and decided to sub for the year after I finished my chemotherapy. This has allowed me to see several different districts and many different schools and to see issues that are repeating themselves from school to school. Here it is:

1. Schools have allowed a ""blame teacher first"" mentality to thrive amongst administration, students, and parents. If a student misbehaves in class, it is never the student's fault. Instead, the blame is assigned to the teacher for having poor classroom management or not building relationships. I don't understand why we can't just teach students to respect all teachers and adults, regardless if they have a ""relationship"" with them. I understand building relationships with students is important, but I've seen it used as a way to assign blame to teachers. 

2. Schools have removed any form of real punishment. Instead of requiring students to come to Saturday school or to clean a hallway, teachers are instead encouraged to ""talk it out"" with students. This works for some students, but I have seen many students figure out that there are no real consequences and that all they need to do is appear sorry and offer a phony apology. 

3. We are warehousing students that don't want to be in school. There are some kids who simply don't thrive in the high school environment. They act out daily because of this and yet we give them no alternatives. Instead of offering them a GED program, vocational skills, or other alternative forms of education, we force them to sit in an English to listen to lectures about a book they aren't reading or sit through math classes they don't understand.

4. Failing has no consequences. I've talked to many teachers that are simply afraid to fail a student, even when they do zero work because of the headache from the administration that will follow. We promote kids to grades they aren't ready for and we are surprised when they struggle. Why are we doing this? Who is benefiting from this?

5. Cell phones are destroying the classroom experience. Schools might say they have no cell phone policy, but give teachers no back up in terms of implementing it. I've talked to teachers berated by their principal for turning a student's cellphone into the office and then be yelled at by the parents. It's somehow become okay to sit through class with your headphones and watch a movie. I've seen many teachers just give up on this issue. Also, if I have to sit through one more meeting where someone who hasn't taught for 20 years tells me I need to figure out how to use the cell phone in the classroom or why I need to tweet, I'm going to scream.

6. 1:1 programs are not good for schools. When students actually ""own"" the laptop, they seem to pretty much use it for social media, games, and pornography. Why does each student need to take home a laptop? I've been in some schools where students check out a laptop for a period and I think that works much better. The idea of owning the technology breeds a sense of entitlement.

7. Some schools have allowed a sense of ownership of the school to pervade through the students and community and not in a good way. Rather than viewing themselves as guests who get to receive this amazing free and public education, students are starting to act as if they own the school and have power over teachers. Scarily, administrations more and more are starting to side with students over teachers.

8. The idea of school administration needs reform. I have been to many schools where I find out that most of the admin only taught for a year or two. Yet, these people are in charge of monitoring the effectiveness of teachers. Requiring five years of teaching experience or changing the role of admin to be half admin, half teacher, would benefit schools and help them see the reality of what's going on. The roles of teachers and admin should be more fluid.

9. The bloated bureaucracy needs to stop. I've been going into schools with 30 students crammed into a classroom, yet somehow area education agencies really seem to be overstaffed with people that just go to a different teacher in service each week and give a presentation on differentiation or whatever the newest trend is, yet these people haven't been the classroom for 20 years. At least in my state, these people are often making 20k more than teachers? Why? It's insanity!

10. Teachers are expected to be martyrs and clowns. If we don't have the student's grades in for an assignment that night, we are somehow lazy even though we were given 150 papers to correct. If our lessons aren't constantly innovative and interactive, we are terrible. Why don't instill a sense that students need to try? Why isn't anything put on the students? It all comes back to the blame teacher first culture.

I understand building relationships with students is important, but I've seen it used as a way to assign blame to teachers. 

2. Schools have removed any form of real punishment. Instead of requiring students to come to Saturday school or to clean a hallway, teachers are instead encouraged to ""talk it out"" with students. This works for some students, but I have seen many students figure out that there are no real consequences and that all they need to do is appear sorry and offer a phony apology. 

3. We are warehousing students that don't want to be in school. There are some kids who simply don't thrive in the high school environment. They act out daily because of this and yet we give them no alternatives. Instead of offering them a GED program, vocational skills, or other alternative forms of education, we force them to sit in an English to listen to lectures about a book they aren't reading or sit through math classes they don't understand.

4. Failing has no consequences. I've talked to many teachers that are simply afraid to fail a student, even when they do zero work because of the headache from the administration that will follow. We promote kids to grades they aren't ready for and we are surprised when they struggle. Why are we doing this? Who is benefiting from this?

5. Cell phones are destroying the classroom experience. Schools might say they have no cell phone policy, but give teachers no back up in terms of implementing it. I've talked to teachers berated by their principal for turning a student's cellphone into the office and then be yelled at by the parents. It's somehow become okay to sit through class with your headphones and watch a movie. I've seen many teachers just give up on this issue. Also, if I have to sit through one more meeting where someone who hasn't taught for 20 years tells me I need to figure out how to use the cell phone in the classroom or why I need to tweet, I'm going to scream.

6. 1:1 programs are not good for schools. When students actually ""own"" the laptop, they seem to pretty much use it for social media, games, and pornography. Why does each student need to take home a laptop? I've been in some schools where students check out a laptop for a period and I think that works much better. The idea of owning the technology breeds a sense of entitlement.

7. Some schools have allowed a sense of ownership of the school to pervade through the students and community and not in a good way. Rather than viewing themselves as guests who get to receive this amazing free and public education, students are starting to act as if they own the school and have power over teachers. Scarily, administrations more and more are starting to side with students over teachers.

8. The idea of school administration needs reform. I have been to many schools where I find out that most of the admin only taught for a year or two. Yet, these people are in charge of monitoring the effectiveness of teachers. Requiring five years of teaching experience or changing the role of admin to be half admin, half teacher, would benefit schools and help them see the reality of what's going on. The roles of teachers and admin should be more fluid.

9. The bloated bureaucracy needs to stop. I've been going into schools with 30 students crammed into a classroom, yet somehow area education agencies really seem to be overstaffed with people that just go to a different teacher in service each week and give a presentation on differentiation or whatever the newest trend is, yet these people haven't been the classroom for 20 years. At least in my state, these people are often making 20k more than teachers? Why? It's insanity!

10. Teachers are expected to be martyrs and clowns. If we don't have the student's grades in for an assignment that night, we are somehow lazy even though we were given 150 papers to correct. If our lessons aren't constantly innovative and interactive, we are terrible. Why don't instill a sense that students need to try? Why isn't anything put on the students? It all comes back to the blame teacher first culture.

What I am seeing really shocks me and makes not want to teach in America again. Most overseas schools are not like this yet, but this environment has become terrible for teachers. Am I wrong or are you seeing the same things at your school? What other problems do you see?",188,compound,-0.9855,2015

My bio teacher had been missing since December 22nd, and that was the last day I ever had class with her. She just up and left without any explanation, and everyone was wondering what happened to her. As it turns out, she went to the doctor's office with stomach pains and gall stones. On January 5th, she was found by hospital staff unable to breathe, unconscious and without a pulse - she went into cardiac arrest. Then, this past Friday, she went into cardiac arrest again. Her brain was irreparably damaged by the lack of oxygen, and she was moved into hospice, where she died quickly and painlessly at 1:45 PM.

Obviously, us being a small school, one of the faculty dying hit all of us exceptionally hard. My math teacher postponed our midterm until tomorrow for memorial reasons. Everyone, normally highly spirited, was deathly silent. Anyone who's ever been in that situation knows exactly what I'm talking about.

And so I appeal to you, r/teachers: in this time of darkness for our school's faculty and students alike, it would be great if you could [leave a kind note](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p3k3MBg-yF7UgUEwTKLdwkfzuRXrdIwtmW4cTOd0CS4/viewform?usp=send_form) for your deceased fellow teacher.

On the Friday before Christmas break, our new (interim) assistant principal came in for an observation.

Thing about that is, in my state (TX), it is against the rules to conduct an evaluation the day before a holiday. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt because she is new, but honestly, she has been an admin and appraiser prior to this, and she really should know better. 

Now, the evaluation wasn't terrible. We were reading The Grinch and making a character analysis chart. She put in the record that my kids were unfocused and needed redirection to focus. I don't want that in my record.

Thing about that is, in my state (TX), it is against the rules to conduct an evaluation the day before a holiday. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt because she is new, but honestly, she has been an admin and appraiser prior to this, and she really should know better. 

Now, the evaluation wasn't terrible. We were reading The Grinch and making a character analysis chart. She put in the record that my kids were unfocused and needed redirection to focus. I don't want that in my record.

I apologize for the wall of text!
I work in a pretty technologically advanced district, so all of my students have iPads and we're a Google Apps for Education district.
Almost three years ago I went to a tech conference and got a great idea to create a ""tour"" of the Crusades through Google Earth. I opened Google Earth, found locations critical to the Crusades, dropped pins, and embedded text, links, and art into those pins. I numbered my pins, so that students went from location to location, in order, studying the causes and effects of each of the major Crusades. From Google Earth, I exported the .kmz file to my own Google account. I gave my students a link so that they could view the tour in Safari or other browser, OR they could view it through Google Earth on their iPads. It was awesome to see the students go from stop to stop, viewing art of the time, clicking on links for more info, and learning about them in a more ""interactive"" way.
(I also did one on the establishment of the colonies and the French and Indian war for my 8th graders.)
THEN . . . Google changed how they do maps. No longer could I upload my .kmz file for my students to have access to my maps through their browsers. Maps have ""layers"" now (kinda like Photoshop), and I just haven't managed to find a way to do what I did before through Google Maps to the same extent that I did through Google Earth. I guess I should say that in the NEW way, I created a layer, linked a .kmz file to it, but it lost all of the ""functionality"" that it previously had when I uploaded the ""old"" way. (I hope this makes sense to someone . . . )
For example, over vacation here, I wanted to start a Medieval China map, with stops important to the Tang through Qing Dynasties. I started with making tester pin for the Forbidden City, but there wasn't a way for me to embed all of the art, links, and other text in the pin I dropped like there was in Google Earth. :( Google WILL allow me to link to a YouTube video or an image URL, but I want hyperlinks, too, to other websites. And, I'm not sure if it will allow me to include text AND a YouTube video, or text AND an image URL, or all three.
So . . . is there someone else out there that is more experienced than I am in this and has managed to make it work, or come up with something similar but maybe using something other than Google? If so, I would love your tips! Thanks!

I'm currently substitute teaching while pursuing initial licensure and M. Ed.. I've worked since about September and things generally have gone well, but I'd love input from you all as well as feedback on what I've learned to do.

Perhaps worth noting that I have worked in grade levels ranging from 2nd to 12th grade and in most subjects. I'm pursuing a degree and licensure in secondary ed, though, so it is the age range I prefer to work with. Most of my practices and questions will relate to secondary ed.

************
First, what I've come up with so far:

(1) Write a general outline of the schedule for class. Helpful as a reference and lets students know what the plan for the day is (they also won't repeatedly ask you what we're doing today).

(2) Greet students at the door as they enter instead of doing something like sitting at the desk. I usually greet them with a good morning or good afternoon, and, if students are trickling in, I ask them how they're doing. Not doing this seems to indicate to students that I'm nervous, afraid, etc.

(3) When bell rings/class is supposed to start, quiet the class down (calmly, no yelling for quiet), and then introduce yourself. Introduction should include:

-Name

-**Expectations and Rules**: I tell them that (a) I want today to be a worthwhile day, that students should learn, not just waste their valuable time; (b) that I expect students to behave as if their normal teacher is here; (c) that I will be writing a note to their teacher about good and bad behavior; and (d) that cell phones may be used for listening to music and class-related activities but otherwise need to be put away, or I will place them on my desk until the end of class.

-Outline for class -- I go over the outline, explain what we will be doing, and ask students if they have any questions.

(4) Try to involve students in any activities the teacher assigns for students. If the teacher left worksheets, I try to have students, particularly the ""hyper"" ones, help me pass those sheets out. 

(5) I try to be flexible with students and let them have input into how work can be done. For example, if students have to do worksheets, I tell them they may work in groups, but if they talk too loudly, get off task, etc., the privilege will taken away, and they will have to work silently by themselves.

(6) If I am teaching the same activity repeatedly (as in, if I have to go through the same activity for four different periods of 9th grade English), I try out different teaching strategies to see how they work. Students become my guinea pigs for testing teaching methods. 

--For example, the first class, I might just do standard whole class analysis of reading. Have students read the text (Popcorn reading?), then ask them questions about the reading. If they have worksheets to do, I'll just have them work quietly by themselves. In the next class, I'll try to mix it up a bit. I could split the students into small groups to discuss the readings (I'll try to come up with some guiding questions), then we come back together and each group member must share one thing. For the worksheet, I could give them the option of working by themselves or in small groups. If things go well, you learn from it, and if things go poorly, you learn from it. Regardless, you aren't teaching these kids all year, so you can gamble on a teaching method and see how things go.

(7) Always try to learn student names, particularly the helpful students (so you can easily get their attention, and they like that you learn their names) and the troublesome students. Sometimes just learning the name of troublesome students is enough to get them to act appropriately. It certainly has almost always resulted in a decrease in bad behavior.

(8) Always keep your calm. I don't know much about other subs, but there appears to be almost an expectation that you as a sub will either just generally stink or will lose your shit. Only subbing at an elementary position made me close to freaking out, but I knew it wouldn't benefit me, instead only making my situation worse. It seems to me that once students see you're interested in helping them and won't have some sort of outburst, they begin to trust you and become more interested in working with you and learning from you.

What do you think of what I've come up with? Any tips you have?

I'd really like input on cell phones. Sometimes I just let students be on their phones. If they've finished the work for the day and aren't distracting other students, at least they aren't causing trouble. I'll ask them if they have some reading, homework, or studying they can do, but sometimes they'll say they have nothing to do. I might ask them to then help their classmates, but it depends on the situation.

I say that I'll place cell phones on my desk, but I haven't really gone through with it. I really don't want to go toe-to-toe with students, in part because it creates a scene and causes all students lose focus on their work. Better one student to be distracted by a phone than an entire class distracted. Should I quietly approach them about it in order to try to prevent a scene?

What do you do when the teacher leaves little to no work? I've generally gone with letting them have a study hall, but it seems so boring and unproductive. Some teachers leave worksheets that take the students no more than 15 minutes to do. We can go over the worksheets together, but that's still only a few more minutes.

I'm currently substitute teaching while pursuing initial licensure and M. Ed.. I've worked since about September and things generally have gone well, but I'd love input from you all as well as feedback on what I've learned to do.

Perhaps worth noting that I have worked in grade levels ranging from 2nd to 12th grade and in most subjects. I'm pursuing a degree and licensure in secondary ed, though, so it is the age range I prefer to work with. Most of my practices and questions will relate to secondary ed.

************
First, what I've come up with so far:

(1) Write a general outline of the schedule for class. Helpful as a reference and lets students know what the plan for the day is (they also won't repeatedly ask you what we're doing today).

(2) Greet students at the door as they enter instead of doing something like sitting at the desk. I usually greet them with a good morning or good afternoon, and, if students are trickling in, I ask them how they're doing. Not doing this seems to indicate to students that I'm nervous, afraid, etc.

(3) When bell rings/class is supposed to start, quiet the class down (calmly, no yelling for quiet), and then introduce yourself. Introduction should include:

-Name

-**Expectations and Rules**: I tell them that (a) I want today to be a worthwhile day, that students should learn, not just waste their valuable time; (b) that I expect students to behave as if their normal teacher is here; (c) that I will be writing a note to their teacher about good and bad behavior; and (d) that cell phones may be used for listening to music and class-related activities but otherwise need to be put away, or I will place them on my desk until the end of class.

-Outline for class -- I go over the outline, explain what we will be doing, and ask students if they have any questions.

(4) Try to involve students in any activities the teacher assigns for students. If the teacher left worksheets, I try to have students, particularly the ""hyper"" ones, help me pass those sheets out. 

(5) I try to be flexible with students and let them have input into how work can be done. For example, if students have to do worksheets, I tell them they may work in groups, but if they talk too loudly, get off task, etc., the privilege will taken away, and they will have to work silently by themselves.

(6) If I am teaching the same activity repeatedly (as in, if I have to go through the same activity for four different periods of 9th grade English), I try out different teaching strategies to see how they work. Students become my guinea pigs for testing teaching methods. 

--For example, the first class, I might just do standard whole class analysis of reading. Have students read the text (Popcorn reading?), then ask them questions about the reading. If they have worksheets to do, I'll just have them work quietly by themselves. In the next class, I'll try to mix it up a bit. I could split the students into small groups to discuss the readings (I'll try to come up with some guiding questions), then we come back together and each group member must share one thing. For the worksheet, I could give them the option of working by themselves or in small groups. If things go well, you learn from it, and if things go poorly, you learn from it. Regardless, you aren't teaching these kids all year, so you can gamble on a teaching method and see how things go.

(7) Always try to learn student names, particularly the helpful students (so you can easily get their attention, and they like that you learn their names) and the troublesome students. Sometimes just learning the name of troublesome students is enough to get them to act appropriately. It certainly has almost always resulted in a decrease in bad behavior.

(8) Always keep your calm. I don't know much about other subs, but there appears to be almost an expectation that you as a sub will either just generally stink or will lose your shit. Only subbing at an elementary position made me close to freaking out, but I knew it wouldn't benefit me, instead only making my situation worse. It seems to me that once students see you're interested in helping them and won't have some sort of outburst, they begin to trust you and become more interested in working with you and learning from you.

I came in late in the school year, so there was a long-term sub in the room for a couple of months and I feel like this has been detrimental to my seniors. I'm a first-year teacher and this past quarter has been a whirlwind of trying to keep my head above water, not just learning the job but also finishing my master's degree. Now that we're going into the second semester, I'm done with graduate school and I also feel like I've got my bearings on what I'm actually supposed to be doing. 

I have little problems with my underclassmen, though admittedly my classroom management needs work. (I have to stop a little too often to settle my rowdy afternoon kids down, but nothing more serious than that.) My senior class, however, is harder to motivate. I have them first thing in the morning, most of them are not English-minded people, and the sub let them slack off so much that now, they don't want to take me seriously.

(Long text inside.)Hi all, I'm teaching high school English and I have mostly underclassmen, plus one section of senior English. I came in late in the school year, so there was a long-term sub in the room for a couple of months and I feel like this has been detrimental to my seniors. I'm a first-year teacher and this past quarter has been a whirlwind of trying to keep my head above water, not just learning the job but also finishing my master's degree. Now that we're going into the second semester, I'm done with graduate school and I also feel like I've got my bearings on what I'm actually supposed to be doing. 

I have little problems with my underclassmen, though admittedly my classroom management needs work. (I have to stop a little too often to settle my rowdy afternoon kids down, but nothing more serious than that.) My senior class, however, is harder to motivate. I have them first thing in the morning, most of them are not English-minded people, and the sub let them slack off so much that now, they don't want to take me seriously. Over the past nine weeks, lessons that I've planned out have fallen flat, projects that I've assigned have gone incomplete, and there have been so many outside senior events (assemblies, etc) that take away from class time.

In this program I am expected to fully take on three classes of my own while spending the rest of my time as an assistant to my mentor teacher, and I am in the school from open to close 5 days a week.  I had the option of working in a suburban or urban setting, and I chose to work in an urban environment for the same reasons most people do.  I think that kids in the urban setting need adult role models much more than those who live in wealthier settings, and I wanted to be one of those adults.  

The beginning of the year went great if you ask me.  I built strong relationships with my kids and I felt that I had truly picked the right profession, but things have began to change since I became the full teacher of three classes.  The kids who once respected me began to walk all over me, and I have gone from being the cool history teacher that everyone loved to being the hardass that is running into constant power-struggles.  Some of the kids who I used to think were fantastic are now becoming my biggest headaches, and I don't know what to do about it.  

On Tuesday my toughest class was particularly poorly behaved, and I decided to devote the beginning of Wednesday's class to discussing behavioral expectations and mutual respect.  This conversation seemed to be effective, and that class went quite smoothly, so today I assumed that this trend would continue, but I was wrong.  Today, the kids came into class very talkative and resistant to redirection.  Once I got them to be quiet, I told them that the assignment they have been working on would be counted as a quiz grade, to which one of my most difficult students yelled out at me ""that's bullshit!""  Now I normally don't do much about profanity if I hear it in passing, (I was a kid once) but to yell it out in the middle of my class directed at me is a totally different story.  I made an example of that girl by issuing a detention, which did not work how I intended.  This girl's best friend then yelled out ""suck my ass,"" so I wrote up another detention form and tried to move on, but then the disrespect continued and I wrote up two more detention forms for other students who swore at me.  At this point I felt I had no other choice but to call the vice principal and have her straighten things out.  I don't like that I had to call for help, but my class had completely turned against me, so I felt that I had no other choice.  Of course after they heard from the assistant principal, they all behaved and apologized but I'm left kind of disheartened.  

I'm beginning to wonder if I can handle working in the urban setting, from a metal-health point of view.  I have spent some time observing suburban schools as part of my program, and despite the fact that it seems boring, I feel like it would be much less stressful overall.  I also think about the fact that suburban teachers have much more freedom because they are usually not on the state's data-radar.  Working in a level-4 school is really tough because the state is completely up our ass about test scores, and so much of my teaching is decided for me by people who think that number-crunching is the answer to education.  I feel like if I worked in a school where test scores are high, my lessons wouldn't be as standardized, and I wouldn't have to devote so much of my lessons to test preparation.  These kids have to take a grand total of 22 standardized tests this year and I know for a fact that suburban kids really only take a few every year.  I haven't forgotten why I wanted to work in urban schools, and I still feel the same way about being a positive role-model for kids who have rough home-lives.  That being said, the problems that I face every day are so mentally taxing that I am currently very conflicted.  I appreciate any advice or support that I can get, and hopefully I will improve over time so that I don't need to start applying to suburban schools.

I'd like them to have to discuss why they think one answer is correct rather than another.

I teach in the U.K. and I’m a primary ECT (first year). I accepted the first job I was offered without thinking about it because I was desperate and just eager to get my own class and etc. Basically, my headteacher is horrible. 5 teachers have left this year since she became the head. We have 9 classes in the school - 5 teachers have been replaced out of 9 teachers. More TA’s have left. We’ve had a new deputy head too. 

The heads whole attitude is “weeding out the week”. For context, I teach a mixed year group 3/4 and really enjoy it! I’ve got some pretty bad behavioural issues in the class (threatening each other with knives, biting incidents, swearing at teachers) sorts of things but out of the 33 in my class it’s only a couple and the rest of them are lovely. 

There have been multiple incidents over the year with this headteacher, such as making us spend our lunch breaks doing playground duty, having multiple staff meetings in the week, having staff meetings the same weeks as parents evening and one of staff members recently became a union rep and the head teacher is NOT happy about it. The head also semi told us off in a staff meeting - it may not have been direct but it was very snide and implied - for being in the staff room during our lunch breaks because she “never took her lunches when she was a teacher” and the concept of spending lunchtimes to not work is “bizarre” to her. 

As an ECT, I will admit I have a tough time asking for help. I’m a ‘just get on with things’ type of person. When I started, I asked for help with things such as marking policies but she would just tell me to ask another member of staff and huff as if I was being annoying so I ended up stopping asking her at all. I often do not get my ECT time during the week and very seldom do I have a TA in my classroom. My classroom has low ability year 3 and high ability year 4 so you can imagine the differentiation/support needed in each lesson, but I don’t complain and I keep going. 

Also to note, no one has ever looked at my lesson plans, my maths books were looked at once, I’ve never had any learning walks/drop ins, and I’ve had a total of 3 ect meetings with my mentor. 

I have been observed twice. The first time, I was horribly ill and my ECT mentor came into my classroom and said “are you ready for your observation?” And I said, “what observation?” It turned out that she’d forgot to send me the email and my observation was in 15 minutes. I got good feedback however! My second observation was this week. I was told the evening before that I would be observed the next morning, giving me a little more time to prep than last time. After the observation my deputy gave me feedback and it seemed ok - but they wanted to observe me again and that I would be seeing them at the end of the day after school. I waited around for them to get out of meetings (marking books in between) and when they came out they said “did no one pass on the message that we didn’t want to see you anymore?” I obviously hadn’t but took it as an opportunity to ask why she wanted to observe me again. She took me into her office and said that my starter task was too similar to my 1st task. I was like, ok, absolutely - that’s an easy fix. She then basically told me I wasn’t doing good enough and I needed more support. She said some horrible things in a very diplomatic way. I said that this was all very sudden. She then said that she was putting me into year 6 next year “so I could be better supported”. Again, this is all VERY new information and she also said my contract was shortened (after saying before that she would make me permanent in September and to not look for other jobs). As most of UK teachers will know, jobs are sparse at this time of year and the bulk of jobs are gone. I asked her if she was saying that it was year 6 or nothing - she said yes. 

What I don’t understand is 1. Why not tell me before nearly the end of the school year that I wasn’t doing well? 2. If I’m not doing well, why put me in year 6, the year group to teach with the MOST pressure, SATS, move up to secondary, etc. ? 

I want to say that I do have low self-esteem but when I was training I never got anything below outstanding on all of my observations, placements, teaching standards in every area. 

Honestly, I’m not sure what to do. I did supply teaching briefly before getting this job and I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed working here. I love the children and my fellow staff but the senior leadership make it very hard. I know I’m working hard and data wise (which I know isn’t everything) all of my children scored higher in their assessments each term and they are making really good progress. 

Basically - I don’t know whether to leave and hope to get a job elsewhere/go back to supply or just put up and shut up. Just looking for any advice really and an excuse to vent, I suppose. Either way - I have 10 days to decide or I’ll be locked into the contract until Christmas.

I have great relationships with teachers there and multiple people from my current school were actually just hired there (which makes this more upsetting) and let's just say, people talk.

So I wanted to go to the wedding instead of the school event. She told me that she needs to check her planning to see if there are enough teachers. I wanted to emphasize that I really want to go to the wedding instead. Then she proceeded to tell me how I asked was not polite. I am not sure how I was being rude by saying ''My cousin's wedding is also next Sunday. I would like to go there for real.''  I said that I don't think I was not rude but still apologized if I caused any misunderstanding. And the day went on.

Teaching while pregnant at a brand new job with so many new classes was a lot. I did my best but I could have done better.

I'm particularly nervous about going back to the elementary school because the younger ones don't do as well with change.

An example:  
As I'm walking to my classroom after checking in this morning (about 7:15AM) I walk near a student (male) who runs over to another student (female) and gives her her backpack while yelling - ""Here's your fucking backpack you dumb bitch"".  Neither of them laugh, it's not a joke.  Neither of them get mad, they're not being aggressive.  That's just the normal.

I contemplate bringing him up to my classroom and lecturing him.  I know this won't do anything except cut into my get-ready-for-the-day time and my peace before the storm.  I settle for quickly calling him out on the behavior and asking him to watch his language.  He looks at me like he has no idea what I'm talking about.  I go on my way.

This is everyday.  It's especially grating in the morning.  Students yelling *fuck you, suck a dick, eat shit,* (etc.) to each other across the school yard with teachers right next to them.

I have an interesting mix of kids this year. 

So yesterday morning while my kids are at specials, my phone rings and its an EA telling me to come to the library right away as there is a situation I need to deal with. Its about a 2 min walk to get there and my mind was racing with what possibly could be going on and I was starting to sweat having no clue what I was about to walk in to. 

As I enter the library I see some of my kids smiling and others turning their backs to me suspiciously. They all gathered around and yelled surprise! It turns out they pooled their own money together (10-11 year olds) and got the EA to purchase a small Keurig for me on Amazon. I drink a lot of coffee and they knew from years past that I always went to other teachers' rooms to make a cup. They also gave me a handmade card that they had painted in art. 

I told them it was the kindest gesture from students I have ever seen and thanked them profusely.

I have an interesting mix of kids this year. 

So yesterday morning while my kids are at specials, my phone rings and its an EA telling me to come to the library right away as there is a situation I need to deal with. Its about a 2 min walk to get there and my mind was racing with what possibly could be going on and I was starting to sweat having no clue what I was about to walk in to. 

As I enter the library I see some of my kids smiling and others turning their backs to me suspiciously. They all gathered around and yelled surprise! It turns out they pooled their own money together (10-11 year olds) and got the EA to purchase a small Keurig for me on Amazon. I drink a lot of coffee and they knew from years past that I always went to other teachers' rooms to make a cup. They also gave me a handmade card that they had painted in art. 

I told them it was the kindest gesture from students I have ever seen and thanked them profusely. They were all beaming and thought it was funny when I told them how I thought I was going to walk into a disaster of some kind.

One day, around Easter, I don’t quite remember exactly what I did but I know it wasn’t that bad, but we had an Easter egg hunt. All the 1st graders got to participate, except me. As a matter of fact, I had to sit there and watch everyone do the egg hunt. And after the hunt was over, I watched everyone in the class showing each other their candy and stuff while I got absolutely nothing. My teacher wouldn’t let me have any candy. It was ridiculous.

I teach in the U.K. and I’m a primary ECT (first year). I accepted the first job I was offered without thinking about it because I was desperate and just eager to get my own class and etc. Basically, my headteacher is horrible. 5 teachers have left this year since she became the head. We have 9 classes in the school - 5 teachers have been replaced out of 9 teachers. More TA’s have left. We’ve had a new deputy head too. 

The heads whole attitude is “weeding out the week”. For context, I teach a mixed year group 3/4 and really enjoy it! I’ve got some pretty bad behavioural issues in the class (threatening each other with knives, biting incidents, swearing at teachers) sorts of things but out of the 33 in my class it’s only a couple and the rest of them are lovely. 

There have been multiple incidents over the year with this headteacher, such as making us spend our lunch breaks doing playground duty, having multiple staff meetings in the week, having staff meetings the same weeks as parents evening and one of staff members recently became a union rep and the head teacher is NOT happy about it. The head also semi told us off in a staff meeting - it may not have been direct but it was very snide and implied - for being in the staff room during our lunch breaks because she “never took her lunches when she was a teacher” and the concept of spending lunchtimes to not work is “bizarre” to her. 

As an ECT, I will admit I have a tough time asking for help. I’m a ‘just get on with things’ type of person. When I started, I asked for help with things such as marking policies but she would just tell me to ask another member of staff and huff as if I was being annoying so I ended up stopping asking her at all. I often do not get my ECT time during the week and very seldom do I have a TA in my classroom. My classroom has low ability year 3 and high ability year 4 so you can imagine the differentiation/support needed in each lesson, but I don’t complain and I keep going. 

Also to note, no one has ever looked at my lesson plans, my maths books were looked at once, I’ve never had any learning walks/drop ins, and I’ve had a total of 3 ect meetings with my mentor. 

I have been observed twice. The first time, I was horribly ill and my ECT mentor came into my classroom and said “are you ready for your observation?” And I said, “what observation?” It turned out that she’d forgot to send me the email and my observation was in 15 minutes. I got good feedback however! My second observation was this week. I was told the evening before that I would be observed the next morning, giving me a little more time to prep than last time. After the observation my deputy gave me feedback and it seemed ok - but they wanted to observe me again and that I would be seeing them at the end of the day after school. I waited around for them to get out of meetings (marking books in between) and when they came out they said “did no one pass on the message that we didn’t want to see you anymore?” I obviously hadn’t but took it as an opportunity to ask why she wanted to observe me again. She took me into her office and said that my starter task was too similar to my 1st task. I was like, ok, absolutely - that’s an easy fix. She then basically told me I wasn’t doing good enough and I needed more support. She said some horrible things in a very diplomatic way. I said that this was all very sudden. She then said that she was putting me into year 6 next year “so I could be better supported”. Again, this is all VERY new information and she also said my contract was shortened (after saying before that she would make me permanent in September and to not look for other jobs). As most of UK teachers will know, jobs are sparse at this time of year and the bulk of jobs are gone. I asked her if she was saying that it was year 6 or nothing - she said yes. 

What I don’t understand is 1. Why not tell me before nearly the end of the school year that I wasn’t doing well? 2. If I’m not doing well, why put me in year 6, the year group to teach with the MOST pressure, SATS, move up to secondary, etc. ? 

I want to say that I do have low self-esteem but when I was training I never got anything below outstanding on all of my observations, placements, teaching standards in every area. 

Honestly, I’m not sure what to do. I did supply teaching briefly before getting this job and I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed working here. I love the children and my fellow staff but the senior leadership make it very hard. I know I’m working hard and data wise (which I know isn’t everything) all of my children scored higher in their assessments each term and they are making really good progress. 

Basically - I don’t know whether to leave and hope to get a job elsewhere/go back to supply or just put up and shut up. Just looking for any advice really and an excuse to vent, I suppose. Either way - I have 10 days to decide or I’ll be locked into the contract until Christmas.

I accepted the first job I was offered without thinking about it because I was desperate and just eager to get my own class and etc. Basically, my headteacher is horrible. 5 teachers have left this year since she became the head. We have 9 classes in the school - 5 teachers have been replaced out of 9 teachers. More TA’s have left. We’ve had a new deputy head too. 

The heads whole attitude is “weeding out the week”. For context, I teach a mixed year group 3/4 and really enjoy it! I’ve got some pretty bad behavioural issues in the class (threatening each other with knives, biting incidents, swearing at teachers) sorts of things but out of the 33 in my class it’s only a couple and the rest of them are lovely. 

There have been multiple incidents over the year with this headteacher, such as making us spend our lunch breaks doing playground duty, having multiple staff meetings in the week, having staff meetings the same weeks as parents evening and one of staff members recently became a union rep and the head teacher is NOT happy about it. The head also semi told us off in a staff meeting - it may not have been direct but it was very snide and implied - for being in the staff room during our lunch breaks because she “never took her lunches when she was a teacher” and the concept of spending lunchtimes to not work is “bizarre” to her. 

As an ECT, I will admit I have a tough time asking for help. I’m a ‘just get on with things’ type of person. When I started, I asked for help with things such as marking policies but she would just tell me to ask another member of staff and huff as if I was being annoying so I ended up stopping asking her at all. I often do not get my ECT time during the week and very seldom do I have a TA in my classroom. My classroom has low ability year 3 and high ability year 4 so you can imagine the differentiation/support needed in each lesson, but I don’t complain and I keep going. 

Also to note, no one has ever looked at my lesson plans, my maths books were looked at once, I’ve never had any learning walks/drop ins, and I’ve had a total of 3 ect meetings with my mentor. 

I have been observed twice. The first time, I was horribly ill and my ECT mentor came into my classroom and said “are you ready for your observation?” And I said, “what observation?” It turned out that she’d forgot to send me the email and my observation was in 15 minutes. I got good feedback however! My second observation was this week. I was told the evening before that I would be observed the next morning, giving me a little more time to prep than last time. After the observation my deputy gave me feedback and it seemed ok - but they wanted to observe me again and that I would be seeing them at the end of the day after school. I waited around for them to get out of meetings (marking books in between) and when they came out they said “did no one pass on the message that we didn’t want to see you anymore?” I obviously hadn’t but took it as an opportunity to ask why she wanted to observe me again. She took me into her office and said that my starter task was too similar to my 1st task. I was like, ok, absolutely - that’s an easy fix. She then basically told me I wasn’t doing good enough and I needed more support. She said some horrible things in a very diplomatic way. I said that this was all very sudden. She then said that she was putting me into year 6 next year “so I could be better supported”. Again, this is all VERY new information and she also said my contract was shortened (after saying before that she would make me permanent in September and to not look for other jobs). As most of UK teachers will know, jobs are sparse at this time of year and the bulk of jobs are gone. I asked her if she was saying that it was year 6 or nothing - she said yes. 

What I don’t understand is 1. Why not tell me before nearly the end of the school year that I wasn’t doing well? 2. If I’m not doing well, why put me in year 6, the year group to teach with the MOST pressure, SATS, move up to secondary, etc. ? 

I want to say that I do have low self-esteem but when I was training I never got anything below outstanding on all of my observations, placements, teaching standards in every area. 

Honestly, I’m not sure what to do. I did supply teaching briefly before getting this job and I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed working here. I love the children and my fellow staff but the senior leadership make it very hard. I know I’m working hard and data wise (which I know isn’t everything) all of my children scored higher in their assessments each term and they are making really good progress. 

Basically - I don’t know whether to leave and hope to get a job elsewhere/go back to supply or just put up and shut up. Just looking for any advice really and an excuse to vent, I suppose. Either way - I have 10 days to decide or I’ll be locked into the contract until Christmas.

But now, my ""dream"" school offered me a 4th grade ELA position and it is more money, right in my town, and differentiated instead of self-contained so I would only teach ELA.

I did notify my lecturer about it and now they want to involve the university in this problem, which includes of some important people from university tagging along with me and observing a lesson taught by the teachers.

How do deal with sustained toxicity, retaliation, and intentional conflict in your workplace?  
I have wanted to mediate this issue for years with my colleague but they continue to refuse mediation and have used it as reason now to exclude me via social leveraging out of community related events and societies I once actively participated in.   


Have I learned that ""if you dont like one of your colleagues, you can just ignore them and choose to not mediate petty conflict indefinitely?""

I am at a loss of what to do because I moved here for this job and it feels my employer and union have used constructive dismissal to make my life miserable. I refuse to leave because I have been here for 7 years, moved to this small tow and bought a house because of this full time continuing job, and after all of this time I do not trust my principal will give me a positive reference.   
I feel stuck and so I wanted to seek the advice from others on what they might do in this instance.   


TL DR;

How do deal with sustained toxicity, retaliation, and intentional conflict in your workplace?  
I have wanted to mediate this issue for years with my colleague but they continue to refuse mediation and have used it as reason now to exclude me via social leveraging out of community related events and societies I once actively participated in.   


Have I learned that ""if you dont like one of your colleagues, you can just ignore them and choose to not mediate petty conflict indefinitely?""

My heart and my career seems to be breaking and I am struggling to deal with my reassignment I have been given for next year as I cannot easily transfer districts or move town. I may inquire about Long Term Disability, but I fear that I will be retaliated at again through a loss of seniority and may be bumped from my school completely (there are no other highschools where I live).

They’re constantly begging to go outside which technically we aren’t supposed to do. We’ve had tons of incidents outside this year. Besides, they go outside for electives every day. A lot of teachers do this anyway, so when I don’t take them they say it’s unfair. In response, they feel they can’t be seated all day and start to run around the room. Today, I was hit with a soccer ball and tripped over backpacks not in the proper spot on the floor. I’ve also had students bump into me as they play fight one another. I finally decided to tell the kids I’m pregnant. They got super quiet. They definitely felt bad (I have a good relationship with all of them) I thought maybe they would be more sensitive. At lunch (which is also In my classroom due to COVID) they were play-fighting again. They threw yogurt in the air which landed all over the floor. I had the other teacher come in and reprimand them. Again, I could have almost gotten hurt. I’m not sure what to do these last few days. Monday my co worker and I planned a very structured day for 7th grade while 8th goes on a field trip. But the last two days? I have a feeling I’ll have them all day again. I do let the kids take breaks to walk outside, but only one at a time. I don’t want to complain here, I just want to make things better. Anything else I can do? Also any way to get through the sheer anxiety of being hurt?

“There are 28 teachers avricksbfhdk….” (Garbled under their mask)

We had MORE kids in the building than ever because multiple students had just finished a ‘bit’ at the alternative campus and we’re back in our general population!

The only answer was to lock down the building and keep all students in one class for the entire day it was absolute torture and every adult I spoke with agreed there was no way they were dealing with this bs again next week.

As soon as I entered the building I could tell something was wrong, admins had panic in their eyes furiously switching channels on their walkie talkies and pointing in all directions trying to disperse groups of ‘children’ (some of which are 14 years old in 6th grade).

I tracked down a skill specialist and asked what was going on…. 

“There are 28 teachers avricksbfhdk….” (Garbled under their mask)

I replied “28 teachers out?!  That’s a new record!”

They replied “No no no 28 teachers total!”

When we opened the school there was a staff of approx. 100, 75 of which were classroom teachers we were down to near 25% staff (not including all the paras, cafeteria staff and custodians that quit long ago) and guess what…. We had MORE kids in the building than ever because multiple students had just finished a ‘bit’ at the alternative campus and we’re back in our general population!

The only answer was to lock down the building and keep all students in one class for the entire day it was absolute torture and every adult I spoke with agreed there was no way they were dealing with this bs again next week.  I can’t wait to see how the district will react when no one comes to work on Monday.

Happy finals week everyone!",180,compound,-0.9837,2022

When I was in second-grade elementary school, I was pulled aside one-on-one during English period, and sent to another teacher. It's been a while ago, so my mind is foggy on the details, but the way I roughly remember it was that I believe I was behind my peers in terms of sentence structure and reading. Not special education, because I didn't have IEP's, but I remember vividly going to this teacher every day and one-on-one, we would talk, and create sentences. Draw pictures or read books in my norebook. Then for homework, we'd create a sentence together, for example like, ""on Sundays, we eat meatballs.""

Then, she'd cut up all of the words, mix them around and put them in an envelope. It was my homework every day to take the jumbled up words and put them back together and glue them for her the next time I saw her. And we did this every day. 

I was too young to remember what her title was or how it evolved after that. But now, I'm thinking that she might have been a speech therapist, or SETTS classroom? Could this also be labeled as resource room, or something else I'm not privy to? 

However, couple things to note. I'm not special education, and never was. I went to a title-1 school, and I believe I saw her every day during English period. I was pulled aside, and it was me and her, one-on-one. Sometimes during reading period, or writing. 

I don't believe I was gifted, it was more I was behind my peers in English. What I also thought was odd was that I was pulled out aside, and not in the classroom. While I understand it now, I thought it was odd at the time.

What I don’t understand is why every two hours teachers are feeding students complete junk that only drives up their blood sugar and promotes childhood obesity. Rarely do I see a healthy snack like fruit or veggies, not even granola bars or yogurt. It’s Oreos, Cheez its, goldfish, “fruit” snacks, and even candy. No wonder these kids are constantly hungry, there’s no nutrition in this food. The lunch isn’t that much better. Kids have enough unhealthy junk at home. Why can’t we put away the snacks and feed students 2-3 generously sized, healthy meals each day?

If you are the teacher that regularly has parents provide these unhealthy snacks for your class , or allow students to bring huge bags of junk that they snack on all day, how do you justify it? Birthday parties and special occasions aside, how is it acceptable to feed kids junk food when rates of childhood obesity in the US are at 20%?",228,compound,0.5399,2022

Background - I’m an elementary school interventionist who gets pulled to sub regularly…

Today I was subbing in a 3rd-grade classroom. There is a paraprofessional in the classroom and she doesn’t speak great English and she’s very hard to understand. 

I taught a math lesson from eureka math about equivalent fractions, after I went through the slide show I had the students move on to their math packets. I sat down at the back table with the students who need extra support and not even 1 minute after sitting down, the para came over (in front of 5-7 students) explaining how the lesson is “all wrong”. Keep in mind several students were waiting to ask me questions such as bathroom break, etc., with that being said many students were up in line waiting to speak with me. She started to “teach me” how the eureka math slides were wrong/how I was wrong and explaining how all the kids were “taught wrong”. As she was trying to explain she kept waving her pencil at me and pointing it at the paper as she was teaching me the lesson. During that time, I repeated to say “I’m sorry, I didn’t choose to make the lesson, I’m just teaching what Mrs. ***** asked me to” because I had students I needed to help. She continued to argue and “teach me”. The kids were all confused as I was sitting there being lectured to and they were all extremely distracted. I went back and checked the PowerPoint to see if I taught it wrong and it looks like I messed up a few slides because it wasn’t set up properly.

I guess I'm sorta looking for support and advice, and sort best practices in the situation.

There's a girl at my school, call her K. I taught her last year, and this year I had her my STAAR Reading test. She's straight up addicted to her cell phone. Like, *well* beyond the bounds of even your average student (which is saying something, as I'm sure you know). Last year it got to the point that I would joke around with her about it; she couldn't put her phone down for more than five seconds, and there were times when she didn't even realize she'd picked it up out of her bag. Today after testing I explicitly told her she couldn't use her phone until she left my room (because STAAR testing - also, it's against school and district policy, though I'm not overly worried about that, tbh). 

All that is just background.

K does not have any accommodations. However, while she was testing I noticed that she would read a single line, then either put her head down (as if about to fall asleep), or start looking around the room like something would happen. I've seen this type of behavior in ADHD kids plenty, but as I said - she's been tested, and she's not (supposedly, anyway). 

My question is: has there been any sort of ""cell phone addiction""-type thing identified in students? My EA said I should just encourage her to use the tools provided in the test, but she *was* using them, and that clearly wasn't enough.

Teaching will be a step down in income, so I’ve accepted that working with cattle or poultry farms in the area may be my summers for a few years, but I really don’t mind doing that if I can teach. I got a couple of praxis tests done so I can be versatile, and I’ve been in touch with a lot of local schools and already know a good number of teachers from various institutions, locally.

I didn’t know if it was the norm to just assume you don’t have what they’re looking for if you just don’t hear anything back..? One other school afforded me the courtesy of being notified of a position being filled, but not this one.

And one job was very clearly posted to fulfill an obligation to make the position publicly known before filling it with who the board planned to, anyway, which makes it all the more frustrating.

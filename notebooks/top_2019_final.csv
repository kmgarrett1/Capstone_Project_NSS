During rehearsals, the girls in the class mentioned that they didn’t like the message as it seemed to tell them that they were defined by a man’s opinion of them.

Her comment was all of 10 seconds and amounted to “we enjoy singing this song, but it implies that we need validation from others and we want you to know... we don’t.” The crowd cheered and it was a sweet moment.

My principal had attended the concert and said he didn’t see anything wrong with what the girls had said, but that I have to be “very careful to not influence my students politically” and “that I should be very vanilla” in my classroom so no one can accuse me of these things.

All of this is supposed to make us feel better, like we're doing something in his honor, and bring feelings of hope, etc., and that's fine.  I can't help to think, though, what if we did this kind of thing if he had reached out for help?  What if, when he told someone he was really down about the break up, someone would have pulled out all the stops and organized half of this to try to help him?  What if we made it so that mental health wasn't such a huge taboo and we actually did something about it?  It is such a screwed up world we lived in that we react instead of pro-act.

One thing I have noticed in my years is our profession is geared to reward those who give all their time to the job and are yes successful but at the cost of their mental health.  Most of the evaluation tools I have used will only give a top score of the teacher goes above and beyond their classroom role, leads groups or activities, volunteers their time, ect ect.  So this I feel opens up pathways to abuse teacher who are willing to give a bit more than normal and use their otherwise free time for the benefit of the district.

Here is my example (that kinda sent me over the edge).  My superintendent wanted a music presentation at our towns 4th of July celebration.  I told her kindly that July 4th is outside of our teachers contracts and it is not appropriate to expect a teacher to come in, prepare a group of kids and give up their 4th of July, a time usually spent with their family.  I wrote up a proposal where we could do a 4 day music camp that would end in the 4th of July performance.  It would be 3 hours of instruction per day so the overall camp would cost the district about $900.  I felt that was relatively easy to find the cash for and then everyone benefits.

I was pretty appalled and of course she wasn’t happy that I couldn’t “persuade” one of my staff members to
do this.

If you are going to do extra work, supervise extra curriculars, write curriculum and lead PD you should be paid for your expertise and your time.

I have yet to see the benefit of fully inclusive classrooms. 

Reality: most teachers have 1, perhaps 2 semesters in Special Ed.

Reality: in a class of 30, 3 will probably have an IEP or 504.

Reality: it's more like 6 everywhere I've taught. 

Opinion: when people outside of the classroom think of Inclusion, they imagine smiling Down's Syndrome Children hugging their classmates.

Reality: IRL, it's a few Traumatic Brain Injuries and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome babies hurling desks and chairs at people. It's a severely ADHD child randomly screaming in a class, scaring the other kids. It's a Spectrum disorder child having a complete meltdown because they are in a space which overstimulates them. In fact, I've had one Down's child in 9 years of teaching. She was amazing, btw.

Reality: it puts children in room less capable of meeting their needs, and takes away instruction time from the other kids in the room.

Opinion: it is stressful for a teacher untrained in Special Ed and, as a Specials teacher who observes, the most frequent response by February is to ignore, placate and push away.

Reality: In the four Title 1 Schools I've worked in, all four managed to skirt giving an aide solely to one child. Aides were shared, leaving teacher alone without help for lengthy periods of time. This meant that the teacher often relied on other students for help and the entire academic level of the classroom plummeted.

Opinion: the needs of the IEP or 504 child are not being met as well. ADHD based solutions or an ADHD friendly classroom with an ADHD specialist teacher throughout elementary could provide severely ADHD kids with the self-guided tools that a general teacher could not. Same with Spectrum. 

Reality: sometimes it isn't safe to have them in the same room and yet districts fail to understand that legally any IEP or 504 child taking away from instruction time of other children or demonstrating violence towards themselves or others can be self-contained. A child should not get a free pass to hurt other kids because they are SpEd. In 9 years, two states and three districts, that is exactly what I have seen.

Opinion: our current model of inclusive classrooms is not ideal and places an undue burden on untrained teachers, puts the child in a room which may cause more stress and therefore trigger more negative reactions, and places an undue burden on the rest of the student population to fear for their safety or to lost instructional time (especially those with undiagnosed disorders whose own abilities to focus are already compromised).

Opinion: I will never say a word of this in my real world. I am very careful to follow every IEP and 504 to the letter, I have gone to every PD offered for this, including summer PDs. My lessons are tiered, and I request regular observations to ensure that I am working well within guidelines. However, I am also looking into Restraint Certification, as a Music Teacher and work closely with my SpEd team to ensure that consequences can still be given to my SpEd students if they disrupt my class beyond their disability. I have had to remove whole classes from the room due to 504 or IEP kids getting violent. To me, this situation is too volatile. 

Opinion: removing self-contained throws the baby out with the bathwater and takes away a valuable tool in elementary school.

He was my inspiration to quit my former career, go back to school, and get my license. 

I’m a first year teacher and I began working at a complex-labeled title 1 high school this January. My kids have been through hell and back and our building isn’t for everyone. I was hired in and essentially left to my own devices. 4 of my 6 classes are a course that I made up entirely. They gave me a description of what they were looking for, the grade levels it would cover (juniors and seniors), two weeks to plan it out, and then to hit the ground running once spring semester began.
I’ve been told for years, even in my former career, that the first year teaching is the hardest. So I went in prepared to make mistakes and fail and that it would be okay. Instead I’ve spent every day feeling really good about what I created, the lessons I made, the atmosphere I influenced, and the challenges I set for these kids. Naturally I’ve been constantly fretting thinking that I’m not doing enough and that maybe I feel THIS good everyday because I’m doing something wrong. No one has told me their first year was this easy. And I still have coworkers who check in on me asking if I’m “still surviving” and it’s obvious they don’t believe me when I tell them I love being here. 

I went to my meeting with the principal prepared for a reality check and I definitely got one. He started off by telling me about the conversation that took place immediately after I walked out of my interview. He said all six of them (principal, VP, and four of the APs) knew they wanted to hire me. He then mentioned that I had requested a sub for this upcoming Monday and since I had requested it a month ago under personal illness, he had wondered if it was because I had lost someone. I briefly mentioned the reason as politely as I could manage. He then said they had sensed I hadn’t “had an easy life” because “no one does that much focused research and certifies themself in every form of suicide and bullying prevention possible just because,” and because of that I may be what their kids need. He went on to tell me how lucky he and admin felt to have me on their team and that after every observation admin has come back saying it “just felt good in there” because I had created such a safe and loving environment. He also began profusely apologizing that they weren’t there to support me and how terrible he felt about it. 

The final topic he wanted to discuss with me was the feedback students gave him. There were students coming to him to tell him all about the great work they’ve been doing in my class. And that, ladies and gents, was the precise moment I started crying. I was so overwhelmed by how much my administration valued and cared for me, that the sudden knowledge that my kids are proud of themselves and the work they’ve done with me struck a chord in my heart. 

And because of this he is renewing me, keeping my course on the roster for next year, and letting me create another new course as well. He’s also asked that next year I work with them directly to educate them about creating safe environments in our building so that they can begin developing team PLs to create a more positive culture for our kids. 

Life is really good, guys.

&amp;#x200B;

\- State Department of Education: A department of education for a particular state typically contains hundreds of different jobs for teachers who want to work directly with the state's commissioner of education to improve education in the state. Although you may not be qualified for each and every job, some of these positions are associated with curriculum and design, assessment, and/or administration. Please check your state's department of education website to be on the look out for possible job opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Teacher Union: Almost all states and school districts are associated with an official teacher union or teacher association that functions as a union. Please be on the look out for job postings for your state's teacher union or the National Education Association.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Assessment Development: Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill, Riverside Publishing (a Houghton Mifflin company), NCS Pearson, The Educational Testing Service, The College Board, American Institutes of Research, Albert.io are always looking for individuals to develop curriculum or write assessment questions for different testing programs. If you are interested in standardized testing, please check out the homepage for each listed company to determine if there is a job opening for you.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Professional Development Companies: The National Mathematics and Science Initiative (NMSI), Kagan Publishing, The College Board, and other professional development companies are always looking for individuals to lead seminars and training sessions across the nation. Why not look into becoming a professional development designing or trainer so that you may travel the world?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Adjunct Teaching: Although the fiscal compensation is not quite as good as being a classroom teacher, you can still live comfortably if you can teach 5-6 classes each semester. Based on my experience and the experience of my colleagues, teaching college is much easier than teaching in the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Policy Development: Your state government and the federal government are always on the lookout for individuals who are interested in developing or promoting particular educational policies. Does this mean that you may have to become a lobbyist? Yes. However, it could still be a fun job without the challenges of dealing with unruly 9th graders.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Science Equipment Companies: PASCO, Vernier, Flinn Scientific, and similar science equipment providers love for former science educators to join their teams to conduct training sessions, create videos, and/or provide support to teachers who have questions about different devices that can be used to collect scientific data. Why not see what these companies have to offer?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Local 4-H Directors: This may not initially seem to be a part of a traditional career trajectory in the field of education, but I have family members who have left the classroom to become directors of local 4-H organizations. They currently make at or above the amount of money that teachers make in my district, and they really do seem to enjoy their jobs.

My offense?  I was looking for a dancing skeleton gif with the lyrics from ""Hips Don't Lie.""  Apparently the results were deemed inappropriate.

(Some of you who don’t have offers yet, sincerely, genuinely don’t despair. Schools higher all summer. New hires in the last week of summer are common) 

Welcome to your first rite of passage. We all ask for advice. We all needed it. Here’s what I can offer you. 

1st. Lean on your coaches, colleagues, and admin. You’ll need it. 

2nd. It really will be a disaster. The learning curve for teachers is unlike anything I’ve ever heard of before. But unless you are a genuinely terrible person you can’t screw up the kids. Do your best. Be professional. Forgive yourself for making mistakes. It’ll happen less often than you fear. You’ll also have great days. Tremendous days. That’s all part of the experience. 

3rd. Take notes. A lot of my early ideas are lost to time because I forgot to write them down. Which is fine. My early ideas largely sucked. But trying new things is how we learn. No good idea is ever really wasted. Keep a journal. Weekly if not daily. Write down what you did, how it went. What new ideas you got from it. How you would do it differently. I have a whole file called “ideas for next year” several now that I think about. These little love letters you send to your future self are vital. 

4th. Document everything. Your classroom management will stink. It’ll be just awful. Whether you’re a drill sergeant, smart ass, hyper organized, a comedian, a cool cat, a dudebro, whatever it’ll bomb. That’s fine. It takes time to grow into your style. Regardless document student behavior. The good. The bad. The weird. Parents and admin and students need to know. The more detailed the better. You’re going to get crushed with work so it sounds like a pain. And it is. It’s a necessary pain. 

5th. Workload. 
Oh my god I about killed myself my first year. This year I’m almost bored. It does get better. You will figure out this nonsense. I can’t be more specific than that because every teacher is different. I could write whole books on different teacher styles I’ve seen. But give your self a break. And if you chuck a pile of worksheets in the bin, I promise no one will know or care. 

6th. Jargon. Jargon is stupid. Write it down. Your school will have a unique way of communicating ideas. When you’re asked to explain your choices during evaluation cycles (or to parents if you have the misfortune to be placed in a district like that) knowing the school jargon will be super helpful. It’s still stupid. 

7th. Evaluation oh. My. God. Does these suck. Grit your teeth and get through it. Take notes. Do what your told. Then in the next cycle tell them how you implemented their “suggestions”. Also tell how you’ve worked with others to inform your practice. But these still suck. Hands down one of the worst parts of being a teacher (on average. Your mileage will vary)

8th. You’re in charge and this includes parents. Usually they’re more afraid of you then you are of them. Make calls home. I didn’t do this enough my first year. “Hello I’m mister sondelmen from Anywhere High.  Is this random student’s mom or dad? I’m just calling to introduce myself and check in with the families. I really think we’re going to have a great year. Do you have any questions or comments for me? No. One last thing then before I let you go, I’d like to stay in touch occasionally this year, is this the best way to contact you or is there a better number? I can also do email if you prefer.” 
Plan to do about 4-6 calls a week even if your school doesn’t require it. Also, take note of coaches. They’re really powerful influences for some kids. Absolutely reach out to them. Coaches are awesome.  Also write this stuff down. If nothing else you can use it as an artifact/evidence for your growth plan.  

Finally. Look. The important thing is not having a perfect year. That’s an unrealistic expectation.

Does anyone else feel this way? Do you guys know any pages that avert this trend?",41,compound,0.3804,2019

I work at one of the worst elementary schools in the state of Illinois. How bad is it? The school (a K-8 building) is overcrowded, is short teachers (we've had several long term subs all year, while a couple of teachers have decided to take time off whenever they so much have a cough), and painfully lacks resources. Our principal is being demoted to assistant principal next year and moved to another school, while all three assistant principals have been demoted and will be back in the classroom after this year. And for good reason: admin has been completely and utterly useless when it comes to dealing with discipline. Our students have quickly learned that there are no actual consequences for their actions, either from admin or at home. Another idea of how bad this place is: our union is intervening because they've received enough complaints from teachers in our building about the conditions here

My class in particular has been horrendous, easily the worst class I've ever taught. I've had more troublemakers in this class than in past years combined. And yet they were actually getting with the program by the time winter break rolled around. To ""reward"" me for having good classroom management, what did admin decide to do? Transfer three of the worst behavior problems from the other third grade classes and put them in my room (on top of saddling me with a few more new students from other schools). This completely disrupted my room, and from February onward I basically turned into a glorified babysitter, spending more time on discipline, and just keeping my room in order rather than teaching. I've never raised my voice as much as I have this year, I've never called parents so many times (180+ so far) and I've never written as many referrals (133 if you're curious, most of which have come since the end of January). This is also the first time in my career I've been hit by students

Last month I ended up taking days off for my own sanity for the first time in my career. I was exhausted by the constant behavior problems and lack of anything being done about them. I did everything I could on my end: rearranging seats, contacting parents, offering incentives, etc. I've always been the type who stayed true to his word regardless of a positive/negative consequence - if I said I would, I did. This has worked at past schools, but here these kids just don't care, no matter how much they missed out on, no matter how many times I called home, no matter how many times wrote them up and sent them out

I was nearing a mental breakdown a couple of weeks ago when  I approached two of my admin (my principal and one of the assistant principals) about what else I could possibly be doing in my room, because what's happening now is unsustainable. Their response? ""I wish I could tell you"". Literal words out of their mouths

And it hit me. I only have eight weeks until the end of the year (seven if you don't count spring break). I'll be leaving at the end of the year (attending grad school in a different city in the fall), my evaluations were done a while ago (which I scored excellent on), and frankly, since admin clearly doesn't want to make the effort, why should I? I decided my students can just have packets of work, and they can sit and work quietly at their desks. For months I tried to actually teach, but given how much time and energy the constant discipline issues sucked out of me, it's just not worth it

So that's just what I'm going to do. They can have work packets until the end of the year. I'm done with admin not backing up their teachers or effectively dealing with discipline. I'm done with students constantly being rude and disrespectful and getting away with it. I'm done with parents not holding up their end of the deal

Sure, some might say ""But these kids won't learn anything! Be patient and keep trying!"" These are the same people who either a) aren't teachers or b) work at a good school. I've given enough of my time and energy to this school, and I'm not going to give any more. If this is what I have to do to survive until the end of the year, so be it

I'm sure many of you are in a similar situation. It might seem like the ""wrong"" thing to do, but you need to take care of you above all else. If that means putting yourself on autopilot and just giving the students worksheets, then do so. If it means taking a day or two off to get yourself together, take those days off. Teaching is just a job like anything else, and it definitely doesn't pay you enough to justify the constant stress and abuse we have to put up with

I have a 7- year old student that is mean, nasty and really loves to lie, and not white lies. *big lies*, like last year he said that I grabbed him by the arm and dragged him across the classroom. What really happened was he was being disruptive and i told him he needed to leave. He goes to my director and tells her what he’s accusing me of, and of course she comes to me and asks me about it. Luckily 3 other teachers were in the room and backed up my side of the story and that was the end of it. 

This year his new tactic includes  hitting and scratching himself and then accusing me of doing the hitting and kicking. He’s going home with bruises and telling his parents it’s me.

Out of five conductors, three exploded at the class. “OH MY GOD YOU GUYS NEVER SHUT UP!” “WE CAN’T PLAY IF YOU’RE TALKING!” “If this was my real job I’da quit immediately.” One of them sprinted out of the room because his classmates were so irritating. 

“Now you know,” I said. And laughed. A lot. 

One of them actually did turn to me and say “Okay, your job is hard.”

I’m into comics and anime and my students know it. I run a Comic Club and show an anime movie in my room after school once a month. Last year, I had a student who adored these clubs.

I would try to get her to enjoy these comics and manga in a healthy way and give her guidance on how to develop her art skills (since I have relatives in design occupations). All in all, it was what it was.

Fast forward to a few months ago. This girl is now a year older and no longer my student but she’s got a step-sister in one of my classes. The student comes in the room asking if I can put up another anime art piece of hers. This wasn’t unusual, since I already had some of her art on the board. Now, I don’t know what about this art piece was so different about the others, but the step-sister FINALLY recognized it was her sister’s art. She goes up to it after class with her phone and takes a picture of it. I thought she was being supportive of her sister so I didn’t say anything, even though it’s against school rules to take pictures.

Whoops. Yeah. Not good. The girl’s father emails me the next day and asks me to take down the art. Turns out, she’s not allowed to participate in ANYTHING related to comics or manga because the stuff she likes is “satanic”. In a single instant, she was “banned” by her father from my room, the clubs, and visiting or talking to me. Practically in tears, she asked me to take down the rest of her art. I asked if I could put it in a private space only I could see like the inside of my closet door and she said yes. (I learned later it was her biological mother who supported her art when she’s at her home. She buys her comics, clothes, and other merchandise.)

Fast forward to now and why I’m so heated at the moment. I learned from some other teachers that the step-sister is expected to tell on her sister if she finds out she’s involved in any of this stuff. She creeps around my room in the morning to make sure her sister’s not there and pretends like she’s just hanging out around there for other reasons. It’s cult-like behavior and it’s disturbing.

*Worse part about it all*, this student was signed up for my Honors course next year since she’s a straight A student. It’s the one her step-sister is in right now. And now, SHE’S NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE MY CLASS. There is no other Honors teacher for her level. Her father is literally putting a stopper on her education because I’m a “bad influence”.

I’m religious myself but holy crap I can’t stand this absolutely shitty behavior. It's unfortunately not the first time I've encountered something like this but it's certainly the worst.

I've been a student teacher; I've been a substitute; I've been a para; but today was finally my first day with my own classroom. 

As I was getting ready at home this morning, for some reason it occurred to me to reach out to my old AP Gov &amp; Politics teacher. He'd been the one who really set me on this path. Teachers like him are very uncommon. And I've had quite high opinions of many teachers over the years.

Anyway, I reached out and told him that I wasn't sure whether he'd remember me or not, but that today was my first day as a high school teacher. I told him I wanted to thank him for the inspiration that his professionalism and enthusiasm gave me, and that all these years, he's been the model that I've been striving towards. 

So I send this message, and I drive to school. The moment I stepped into my classroom, he video called me. I picked up, and he yelled, ""Of course I remember you, c'mon!"" He told me that my message had been very timely for him, and he encouraged me to expect equally timely messages in my own inbox years from now, seemingly always right when you need them the most.

I've been a student teacher; I've been a substitute; I've been a para; but today was finally my first day with my own classroom. 

As I was getting ready at home this morning, for some reason it occurred to me to reach out to my old AP Gov &amp; Politics teacher. He'd been the one who really set me on this path. Teachers like him are very uncommon. And I've had quite high opinions of many teachers over the years.

Anyway, I reached out and told him that I wasn't sure whether he'd remember me or not, but that today was my first day as a high school teacher. I told him I wanted to thank him for the inspiration that his professionalism and enthusiasm gave me, and that all these years, he's been the model that I've been striving towards. 

So I send this message, and I drive to school. The moment I stepped into my classroom, he video called me. I picked up, and he yelled, ""Of course I remember you, c'mon!"" He told me that my message had been very timely for him, and he encouraged me to expect equally timely messages in my own inbox years from now, seemingly always right when you need them the most. We couldn't talk long, as I had my first faculty meeting coming up in 5 or 10 minutes, but he spent the rest of the conversation giving me great advice and encouragement.

My women’s choir sang a musical theatre arrangement of “I Feel Pretty” which end with a lyric that says something like “I feel pretty because I’m loved by a boy”. During rehearsals, the girls in the class mentioned that they didn’t like the message as it seemed to tell them that they were defined by a man’s opinion of them. I thought it was a good opportunity to talk self speech and positive body image since so many of these girls struggle with their self view. After this discussion, one of my seniors asked to say something at the concert before we sang this song about how they feel beautiful regardless of other opinions. I thought, wow! Sounds great!

Her comment was all of 10 seconds and amounted to “we enjoy singing this song, but it implies that we need validation from others and we want you to know... we don’t.” The crowd cheered and it was a sweet moment. Until the next day when my principal told me that a dad called and complained about me pushing a leftist agenda onto my kids. My principal had attended the concert and said he didn’t see anything wrong with what the girls had said, but that I have to be “very careful to not influence my students politically” and “that I should be very vanilla” in my classroom so no one can accuse me of these things. 

WTF. I honestly don’t know how I could’ve handled  that whole situation any better as a teacher. What was I supposed to do? Tell them that their worth WAS defined by a man?

Most of the evaluation tools I have used will only give a top score of the teacher goes above and beyond their classroom role, leads groups or activities, volunteers their time, ect ect.  So this I feel opens up pathways to abuse teacher who are willing to give a bit more than normal and use their otherwise free time for the benefit of the district.

Here is my example (that kinda sent me over the edge).  My superintendent wanted a music presentation at our towns 4th of July celebration.  I told her kindly that July 4th is outside of our teachers contracts and it is not appropriate to expect a teacher to come in, prepare a group of kids and give up their 4th of July, a time usually spent with their family.  I wrote up a proposal where we could do a 4 day music camp that would end in the 4th of July performance.  It would be 3 hours of instruction per day so the overall camp would cost the district about $900.  I felt that was relatively easy to find the cash for and then everyone benefits.

I was pretty appalled and of course she wasn’t happy that I couldn’t “persuade” one of my staff members to
do this.

If you are going to do extra work, supervise extra curriculars, write curriculum and lead PD you should be paid for your expertise and your time.

I have yet to see the benefit of fully inclusive classrooms. 

Reality: most teachers have 1, perhaps 2 semesters in Special Ed.

Reality: in a class of 30, 3 will probably have an IEP or 504.

Reality: it's more like 6 everywhere I've taught. 

Opinion: when people outside of the classroom think of Inclusion, they imagine smiling Down's Syndrome Children hugging their classmates.

Reality: IRL, it's a few Traumatic Brain Injuries and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome babies hurling desks and chairs at people. It's a severely ADHD child randomly screaming in a class, scaring the other kids. It's a Spectrum disorder child having a complete meltdown because they are in a space which overstimulates them. In fact, I've had one Down's child in 9 years of teaching. She was amazing, btw.

Reality: it puts children in room less capable of meeting their needs, and takes away instruction time from the other kids in the room.

Opinion: it is stressful for a teacher untrained in Special Ed and, as a Specials teacher who observes, the most frequent response by February is to ignore, placate and push away.

Reality: In the four Title 1 Schools I've worked in, all four managed to skirt giving an aide solely to one child. Aides were shared, leaving teacher alone without help for lengthy periods of time. This meant that the teacher often relied on other students for help and the entire academic level of the classroom plummeted.

Opinion: the needs of the IEP or 504 child are not being met as well. ADHD based solutions or an ADHD friendly classroom with an ADHD specialist teacher throughout elementary could provide severely ADHD kids with the self-guided tools that a general teacher could not. Same with Spectrum. 

Reality: sometimes it isn't safe to have them in the same room and yet districts fail to understand that legally any IEP or 504 child taking away from instruction time of other children or demonstrating violence towards themselves or others can be self-contained. A child should not get a free pass to hurt other kids because they are SpEd. In 9 years, two states and three districts, that is exactly what I have seen.

Opinion: our current model of inclusive classrooms is not ideal and places an undue burden on untrained teachers, puts the child in a room which may cause more stress and therefore trigger more negative reactions, and places an undue burden on the rest of the student population to fear for their safety or to lost instructional time (especially those with undiagnosed disorders whose own abilities to focus are already compromised).

Opinion: I will never say a word of this in my real world. I am very careful to follow every IEP and 504 to the letter, I have gone to every PD offered for this, including summer PDs. My lessons are tiered, and I request regular observations to ensure that I am working well within guidelines. However, I am also looking into Restraint Certification, as a Music Teacher and work closely with my SpEd team to ensure that consequences can still be given to my SpEd students if they disrupt my class beyond their disability. I have had to remove whole classes from the room due to 504 or IEP kids getting violent. To me, this situation is too volatile. 

Opinion: removing self-contained throws the baby out with the bathwater and takes away a valuable tool in elementary school.

He was my inspiration to quit my former career, go back to school, and get my license. 

I’m a first year teacher and I began working at a complex-labeled title 1 high school this January. My kids have been through hell and back and our building isn’t for everyone. I was hired in and essentially left to my own devices. 4 of my 6 classes are a course that I made up entirely. They gave me a description of what they were looking for, the grade levels it would cover (juniors and seniors), two weeks to plan it out, and then to hit the ground running once spring semester began.
I’ve been told for years, even in my former career, that the first year teaching is the hardest. So I went in prepared to make mistakes and fail and that it would be okay. Instead I’ve spent every day feeling really good about what I created, the lessons I made, the atmosphere I influenced, and the challenges I set for these kids. Naturally I’ve been constantly fretting thinking that I’m not doing enough and that maybe I feel THIS good everyday because I’m doing something wrong. No one has told me their first year was this easy. And I still have coworkers who check in on me asking if I’m “still surviving” and it’s obvious they don’t believe me when I tell them I love being here. 

I went to my meeting with the principal prepared for a reality check and I definitely got one. He started off by telling me about the conversation that took place immediately after I walked out of my interview. He said all six of them (principal, VP, and four of the APs) knew they wanted to hire me. He then mentioned that I had requested a sub for this upcoming Monday and since I had requested it a month ago under personal illness, he had wondered if it was because I had lost someone. I briefly mentioned the reason as politely as I could manage. He then said they had sensed I hadn’t “had an easy life” because “no one does that much focused research and certifies themself in every form of suicide and bullying prevention possible just because,” and because of that I may be what their kids need. He went on to tell me how lucky he and admin felt to have me on their team and that after every observation admin has come back saying it “just felt good in there” because I had created such a safe and loving environment. He also began profusely apologizing that they weren’t there to support me and how terrible he felt about it. 

The final topic he wanted to discuss with me was the feedback students gave him. There were students coming to him to tell him all about the great work they’ve been doing in my class. And that, ladies and gents, was the precise moment I started crying. I was so overwhelmed by how much my administration valued and cared for me, that the sudden knowledge that my kids are proud of themselves and the work they’ve done with me struck a chord in my heart. 

And because of this he is renewing me, keeping my course on the roster for next year, and letting me create another new course as well. He’s also asked that next year I work with them directly to educate them about creating safe environments in our building so that they can begin developing team PLs to create a more positive culture for our kids.

This is the type of attitude that we need to eliminate in our already frail public education system.

This post is intended to help teachers who want to leave the classroom. I want to provide SPECIFIC careers that teachers can explore so that they can leave the classroom and find happiness in other education related fields. I encourage the high quality educators in this sub to reply with other REALISTIC job opportunities for teachers who want to leave the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

\- State Department of Education: A department of education for a particular state typically contains hundreds of different jobs for teachers who want to work directly with the state's commissioner of education to improve education in the state. Although you may not be qualified for each and every job, some of these positions are associated with curriculum and design, assessment, and/or administration. Please check your state's department of education website to be on the look out for possible job opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Teacher Union: Almost all states and school districts are associated with an official teacher union or teacher association that functions as a union. Please be on the look out for job postings for your state's teacher union or the National Education Association.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Assessment Development: Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill, Riverside Publishing (a Houghton Mifflin company), NCS Pearson, The Educational Testing Service, The College Board, American Institutes of Research, Albert.io are always looking for individuals to develop curriculum or write assessment questions for different testing programs. If you are interested in standardized testing, please check out the homepage for each listed company to determine if there is a job opening for you.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Professional Development Companies: The National Mathematics and Science Initiative (NMSI), Kagan Publishing, The College Board, and other professional development companies are always looking for individuals to lead seminars and training sessions across the nation. Why not look into becoming a professional development designing or trainer so that you may travel the world?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Adjunct Teaching: Although the fiscal compensation is not quite as good as being a classroom teacher, you can still live comfortably if you can teach 5-6 classes each semester. Based on my experience and the experience of my colleagues, teaching college is much easier than teaching in the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Policy Development: Your state government and the federal government are always on the lookout for individuals who are interested in developing or promoting particular educational policies. Does this mean that you may have to become a lobbyist? Yes. However, it could still be a fun job without the challenges of dealing with unruly 9th graders.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Science Equipment Companies: PASCO, Vernier, Flinn Scientific, and similar science equipment providers love for former science educators to join their teams to conduct training sessions, create videos, and/or provide support to teachers who have questions about different devices that can be used to collect scientific data. Why not see what these companies have to offer?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Local 4-H Directors: This may not initially seem to be a part of a traditional career trajectory in the field of education, but I have family members who have left the classroom to become directors of local 4-H organizations. They currently make at or above the amount of money that teachers make in my district, and they really do seem to enjoy their jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

As I think of more job opportunities, I will add the information to the already existing list. However, for now, this main post should provide a great jumping off point for teachers who want to explore different avenues outside of the classroom.

As a current district administrator, I am embarrassed by most of the users in this sub who refuse to help the teachers who want to leave the classroom. I know from first hand experience that the worst districts are districts where teachers continue to teach who believe that there is no other way out of the classroom. To some of you in this sub, I realize that you think others should suffer in the classroom since you are currently suffering, but you need to end your gate-keeping elitism and help others who need a way out of the classroom. For these individuals, does it bother you that you feel as if you are stuck in a classroom while other teachers leave the profession to pursue career opportunities more in line with what they want out of life? You should be ashamed, and you should know that you are the type of person who I would never allow to teach in my own school district. This is the type of attitude that we need to eliminate in our already frail public education system.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is intended to help teachers who want to leave the classroom. I want to provide SPECIFIC careers that teachers can explore so that they can leave the classroom and find happiness in other education related fields. I encourage the high quality educators in this sub to reply with other REALISTIC job opportunities for teachers who want to leave the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

\- State Department of Education: A department of education for a particular state typically contains hundreds of different jobs for teachers who want to work directly with the state's commissioner of education to improve education in the state. Although you may not be qualified for each and every job, some of these positions are associated with curriculum and design, assessment, and/or administration. Please check your state's department of education website to be on the look out for possible job opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Teacher Union: Almost all states and school districts are associated with an official teacher union or teacher association that functions as a union. Please be on the look out for job postings for your state's teacher union or the National Education Association.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Assessment Development: Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill, Riverside Publishing (a Houghton Mifflin company), NCS Pearson, The Educational Testing Service, The College Board, American Institutes of Research, Albert.io are always looking for individuals to develop curriculum or write assessment questions for different testing programs. If you are interested in standardized testing, please check out the homepage for each listed company to determine if there is a job opening for you.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Professional Development Companies: The National Mathematics and Science Initiative (NMSI), Kagan Publishing, The College Board, and other professional development companies are always looking for individuals to lead seminars and training sessions across the nation. Why not look into becoming a professional development designing or trainer so that you may travel the world?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Adjunct Teaching: Although the fiscal compensation is not quite as good as being a classroom teacher, you can still live comfortably if you can teach 5-6 classes each semester. Based on my experience and the experience of my colleagues, teaching college is much easier than teaching in the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Policy Development: Your state government and the federal government are always on the lookout for individuals who are interested in developing or promoting particular educational policies. Does this mean that you may have to become a lobbyist? Yes. However, it could still be a fun job without the challenges of dealing with unruly 9th graders.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Science Equipment Companies: PASCO, Vernier, Flinn Scientific, and similar science equipment providers love for former science educators to join their teams to conduct training sessions, create videos, and/or provide support to teachers who have questions about different devices that can be used to collect scientific data. Why not see what these companies have to offer?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Local 4-H Directors: This may not initially seem to be a part of a traditional career trajectory in the field of education, but I have family members who have left the classroom to become directors of local 4-H organizations. They currently make at or above the amount of money that teachers make in my district, and they really do seem to enjoy their jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

As I think of more job opportunities, I will add the information to the already existing list. However, for now, this main post should provide a great jumping off point for teachers who want to explore different avenues outside of the classroom. I continue to remain bewildered that I even had to create this post due to the fact that most users in this sub, up to this point, have been very unhelpful to teachers who want to leave the profession.",126,compound,0.9982,2019

(Some of you who don’t have offers yet, sincerely, genuinely don’t despair. Schools higher all summer. New hires in the last week of summer are common) 

Welcome to your first rite of passage. We all ask for advice. We all needed it. Here’s what I can offer you. 

1st. Lean on your coaches, colleagues, and admin. You’ll need it. 

2nd. It really will be a disaster. The learning curve for teachers is unlike anything I’ve ever heard of before. But unless you are a genuinely terrible person you can’t screw up the kids. Do your best. Be professional. Forgive yourself for making mistakes. It’ll happen less often than you fear. You’ll also have great days. Tremendous days. That’s all part of the experience. 

3rd. Take notes. A lot of my early ideas are lost to time because I forgot to write them down. Which is fine. My early ideas largely sucked. But trying new things is how we learn. No good idea is ever really wasted. Keep a journal. Weekly if not daily. Write down what you did, how it went. What new ideas you got from it. How you would do it differently. I have a whole file called “ideas for next year” several now that I think about. These little love letters you send to your future self are vital. 

4th. Document everything. Your classroom management will stink. It’ll be just awful. Whether you’re a drill sergeant, smart ass, hyper organized, a comedian, a cool cat, a dudebro, whatever it’ll bomb. That’s fine. It takes time to grow into your style. Regardless document student behavior. The good. The bad. The weird. Parents and admin and students need to know. The more detailed the better. You’re going to get crushed with work so it sounds like a pain. And it is. It’s a necessary pain. 

5th. Workload. 
Oh my god I about killed myself my first year. This year I’m almost bored. It does get better. You will figure out this nonsense. I can’t be more specific than that because every teacher is different. I could write whole books on different teacher styles I’ve seen. But give your self a break. And if you chuck a pile of worksheets in the bin, I promise no one will know or care. 

6th. Jargon. Jargon is stupid. Write it down. Your school will have a unique way of communicating ideas. When you’re asked to explain your choices during evaluation cycles (or to parents if you have the misfortune to be placed in a district like that) knowing the school jargon will be super helpful. It’s still stupid. 

7th. Evaluation oh. My. God. Does these suck. Grit your teeth and get through it. Take notes. Do what your told. Then in the next cycle tell them how you implemented their “suggestions”. Also tell how you’ve worked with others to inform your practice. But these still suck. Hands down one of the worst parts of being a teacher (on average. Your mileage will vary)

8th. You’re in charge and this includes parents. Usually they’re more afraid of you then you are of them. Make calls home. I didn’t do this enough my first year. “Hello I’m mister sondelmen from Anywhere High.  Is this random student’s mom or dad? I’m just calling to introduce myself and check in with the families. I really think we’re going to have a great year. Do you have any questions or comments for me? No. One last thing then before I let you go, I’d like to stay in touch occasionally this year, is this the best way to contact you or is there a better number? I can also do email if you prefer.” 
Plan to do about 4-6 calls a week even if your school doesn’t require it. Also, take note of coaches. They’re really powerful influences for some kids. Absolutely reach out to them. Coaches are awesome.  Also write this stuff down. If nothing else you can use it as an artifact/evidence for your growth plan.  

Finally. Look. The important thing is not having a perfect year. That’s an unrealistic expectation.

I work at one of the worst elementary schools in the state of Illinois. How bad is it? The school (a K-8 building) is overcrowded, is short teachers (we've had several long term subs all year, while a couple of teachers have decided to take time off whenever they so much have a cough), and painfully lacks resources. Our principal is being demoted to assistant principal next year and moved to another school, while all three assistant principals have been demoted and will be back in the classroom after this year. And for good reason: admin has been completely and utterly useless when it comes to dealing with discipline. Our students have quickly learned that there are no actual consequences for their actions, either from admin or at home. Another idea of how bad this place is: our union is intervening because they've received enough complaints from teachers in our building about the conditions here

My class in particular has been horrendous, easily the worst class I've ever taught. I've had more troublemakers in this class than in past years combined. And yet they were actually getting with the program by the time winter break rolled around. To ""reward"" me for having good classroom management, what did admin decide to do? Transfer three of the worst behavior problems from the other third grade classes and put them in my room (on top of saddling me with a few more new students from other schools). This completely disrupted my room, and from February onward I basically turned into a glorified babysitter, spending more time on discipline, and just keeping my room in order rather than teaching. I've never raised my voice as much as I have this year, I've never called parents so many times (180+ so far) and I've never written as many referrals (133 if you're curious, most of which have come since the end of January). This is also the first time in my career I've been hit by students

Last month I ended up taking days off for my own sanity for the first time in my career. I was exhausted by the constant behavior problems and lack of anything being done about them. I did everything I could on my end: rearranging seats, contacting parents, offering incentives, etc. I've always been the type who stayed true to his word regardless of a positive/negative consequence - if I said I would, I did. This has worked at past schools, but here these kids just don't care, no matter how much they missed out on, no matter how many times I called home, no matter how many times wrote them up and sent them out

I was nearing a mental breakdown a couple of weeks ago when  I approached two of my admin (my principal and one of the assistant principals) about what else I could possibly be doing in my room, because what's happening now is unsustainable. Their response? ""I wish I could tell you"". Literal words out of their mouths

And it hit me. I only have eight weeks until the end of the year (seven if you don't count spring break). I'll be leaving at the end of the year (attending grad school in a different city in the fall), my evaluations were done a while ago (which I scored excellent on), and frankly, since admin clearly doesn't want to make the effort, why should I? I decided my students can just have packets of work, and they can sit and work quietly at their desks. For months I tried to actually teach, but given how much time and energy the constant discipline issues sucked out of me, it's just not worth it

So that's just what I'm going to do. They can have work packets until the end of the year. I'm done with admin not backing up their teachers or effectively dealing with discipline. I'm done with students constantly being rude and disrespectful and getting away with it. I'm done with parents not holding up their end of the deal

Sure, some might say ""But these kids won't learn anything! Be patient and keep trying!"" These are the same people who either a) aren't teachers or b) work at a good school. I've given enough of my time and energy to this school, and I'm not going to give any more. If this is what I have to do to survive until the end of the year, so be it

I'm sure many of you are in a similar situation. It might seem like the ""wrong"" thing to do, but you need to take care of you above all else. If that means putting yourself on autopilot and just giving the students worksheets, then do so. If it means taking a day or two off to get yourself together, take those days off. Teaching is just a job like anything else, and it definitely doesn't pay you enough to justify the constant stress and abuse we have to put up with

I have a 7- year old student that is mean, nasty and really loves to lie, and not white lies. *big lies*, like last year he said that I grabbed him by the arm and dragged him across the classroom. What really happened was he was being disruptive and i told him he needed to leave. He goes to my director and tells her what he’s accusing me of, and of course she comes to me and asks me about it. Luckily 3 other teachers were in the room and backed up my side of the story and that was the end of it. 

This year his new tactic includes  hitting and scratching himself and then accusing me of doing the hitting and kicking. He’s going home with bruises and telling his parents it’s me. They come in fuming at me, and i’ve explained it’s not me. But of course he’s got the bruises and it’s looking bad for me because they don’t belive he could possibly be doing it himself. 

Parents start threatening legal action and things were looking bad for me but i had *a plan* . I thought well i could record him flipping the fuck out but i didn’t want anyone to say it was edited or tampered with. So i waited right when we got outside for recess right in front of the schools security cameras. I told him that he wasn’t allowed to play and must sit on the stairs for previous bad behavior he exhibited during class time. He flips a living shit. starts slapping and punching himself in the face screaming “stop miss. NotStephany, stop hitting me!!” all while doing all this to himself. The security camera is catching the whole thing. and i’m just staring up at the camera, and i had to stop myself from smiling. 

So later in the day his parents come in ready to murder me, they see his bruises threatening to call the police. and i’m grinning from ear to ear. I calmly ask the demon student what happened. He basically said i beat the shit out of him on the play ground. I say, well there *are* security camera back there. Maybe we should watch it. 


All the anger turns to shock as they see they’re son beating himself to a pulp and me standing 5 feet away.

This year his new tactic includes  hitting and scratching himself and then accusing me of doing the hitting and kicking. He’s going home with bruises and telling his parents it’s me. They come in fuming at me, and i’ve explained it’s not me. But of course he’s got the bruises and it’s looking bad for me because they don’t belive he could possibly be doing it himself. 

Parents start threatening legal action and things were looking bad for me but i had *a plan* . I thought well i could record him flipping the fuck out but i didn’t want anyone to say it was edited or tampered with. So i waited right when we got outside for recess right in front of the schools security cameras. I told him that he wasn’t allowed to play and must sit on the stairs for previous bad behavior he exhibited during class time. He flips a living shit. starts slapping and punching himself in the face screaming “stop miss. NotStephany, stop hitting me!!” all while doing all this to himself. The security camera is catching the whole thing. and i’m just staring up at the camera, and i had to stop myself from smiling. 

So later in the day his parents come in ready to murder me, they see his bruises threatening to call the police. and i’m grinning from ear to ear. I calmly ask the demon student what happened. He basically said i beat the shit out of him on the play ground. I say, well there *are* security camera back there. Maybe we should watch it. 


All the anger turns to shock as they see they’re son beating himself to a pulp and me standing 5 feet away. I didn’t get an apology but they did say “they’ll speak to him about his actions” what ever that means. They haven’t bothered me since",140,compound,-0.9926,2019

I would try to get her to enjoy these comics and manga in a healthy way and give her guidance on how to develop her art skills (since I have relatives in design occupations). All in all, it was what it was.

Fast forward to a few months ago. This girl is now a year older and no longer my student but she’s got a step-sister in one of my classes. The student comes in the room asking if I can put up another anime art piece of hers. This wasn’t unusual, since I already had some of her art on the board. Now, I don’t know what about this art piece was so different about the others, but the step-sister FINALLY recognized it was her sister’s art. She goes up to it after class with her phone and takes a picture of it. I thought she was being supportive of her sister so I didn’t say anything, even though it’s against school rules to take pictures.

Whoops. Yeah. Not good. The girl’s father emails me the next day and asks me to take down the art. Turns out, she’s not allowed to participate in ANYTHING related to comics or manga because the stuff she likes is “satanic”. In a single instant, she was “banned” by her father from my room, the clubs, and visiting or talking to me. Practically in tears, she asked me to take down the rest of her art. I asked if I could put it in a private space only I could see like the inside of my closet door and she said yes. (I learned later it was her biological mother who supported her art when she’s at her home. She buys her comics, clothes, and other merchandise.)

Fast forward to now and why I’m so heated at the moment. I learned from some other teachers that the step-sister is expected to tell on her sister if she finds out she’s involved in any of this stuff. She creeps around my room in the morning to make sure her sister’s not there and pretends like she’s just hanging out around there for other reasons. It’s cult-like behavior and it’s disturbing.

*Worse part about it all*, this student was signed up for my Honors course next year since she’s a straight A student. It’s the one her step-sister is in right now. And now, SHE’S NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE MY CLASS. There is no other Honors teacher for her level. Her father is literally putting a stopper on her education because I’m a “bad influence”.

I’m religious myself but holy crap I can’t stand this absolutely shitty behavior. It's unfortunately not the first time I've encountered something like this but it's certainly the worst.

I've been a student teacher; I've been a substitute; I've been a para; but today was finally my first day with my own classroom. 

As I was getting ready at home this morning, for some reason it occurred to me to reach out to my old AP Gov &amp; Politics teacher. He'd been the one who really set me on this path. Teachers like him are very uncommon. And I've had quite high opinions of many teachers over the years.

Anyway, I reached out and told him that I wasn't sure whether he'd remember me or not, but that today was my first day as a high school teacher. I told him I wanted to thank him for the inspiration that his professionalism and enthusiasm gave me, and that all these years, he's been the model that I've been striving towards. 

So I send this message, and I drive to school. The moment I stepped into my classroom, he video called me. I picked up, and he yelled, ""Of course I remember you, c'mon!"" He told me that my message had been very timely for him, and he encouraged me to expect equally timely messages in my own inbox years from now, seemingly always right when you need them the most. We couldn't talk long, as I had my first faculty meeting coming up in 5 or 10 minutes, but he spent the rest of the conversation giving me great advice and encouragement.

But today I was lifted up by the generous and wise words of a former mentor turned fellow professional, and I can't tell you what that did for my morale today. I still have no clue what I'm doing.

I'm still probably going to have admin and department heads knocking on my door to talk to me about some process or other thing that I'm supposed to be doing and was completely unaware of, and it'll stress the crap out of me.

She didn't get an A, because her grades were missing many assignments. But because she discussed her issues at home, and the pressure she was under, I accepted late work and she did enough make-up work to let me know she was determined to fix the one incident.

I was cleaning up my classroom and she had left a note under my door. Thanking me for believing in her.

This is what killed me. ""I know sometimes you say you should have never become a teacher, the lack of respect. Please keep teaching.""",183,compound,0.3392,2019

I caught six little red cuts on one of my 6th graders' wrist yesterday morning. Classic self injury cuts. Bright red, so probably fairly new. She covered it up and I pretended not to notice.

Two mods later I have plan, so I talk with the counselor (email and in person.) The counselor immediately pulls her from class and makes her bring all her stuff. I caught on a passing radio she got an administrator involved. It looks to me like they're treating her like a suicide risk. If that's the case, that's a phone call home and her parents have to pick her up from school.

I caught six little red cuts on one of my 6th graders' wrist yesterday morning. Classic self injury cuts. Bright red, so probably fairly new. She covered it up and I pretended not to notice.

Two mods later I have plan, so I talk with the counselor (email and in person.) The counselor immediately pulls her from class and makes her bring all her stuff. I caught on a passing radio she got an administrator involved. It looks to me like they're treating her like a suicide risk. If that's the case, that's a phone call home and her parents have to pick her up from school.

The post &amp; video state that the child was lost 3 times. First off it seems like it's kinda sorty click-baity but not entirely inaccurate according to the story.

Link to news story: https://www.ajc.com/news/local/father-tirade-over-girl-left-behind-prompts-school-apology/RQGtJnSm1LgLgrvhyVfz4H/

Basically the little kindergartner girl missed her bus 3 times over the course of the school year. The clickbait title makes it seem like she just wandered out of school ground on her own; no she just missed her bus a bunch of times. In this particular instance, her brother was aware of her being missing and informed an adult to wait for her, but the bus still left.

Parent was obviously upset (and rightfully so), and the school seems to have tried to pull the ""we're out at 4PM, please come get them by this time"" card. Technically yes the school is out at 4PM, but we usually have qualified admins/teachers drive kids if necessary.

I don't know about all of you, but this happens a lot more than we would like at our school. Kids ask to go to the bathroom or just aren't paying attention during bus dismissal time. They miss the bus and we kinda have to cross our fingers that the parents are going to be both available and understanding.

Recently we had a few kids intentionally lie to us that their mom was picking them up. Like, these kids were supposed to ride the bus but skipped the bus to play with an athletic club after school. They told us they had permission to stay after school &amp; mom was picking them up, so we let them stay. The mom was not informed and was wondering why her kids didn't show up on the bus. Welp, it's because your kids are manipulative undisciplined assholes who think they can do what they want without consequences.

I really hate working bus duty, but it's stuff like this that I'm always afraid of.

The teachers have a right to a social life and be done with work on time, and they also shouldn't have to be a personal caretaker for irresponsible students.

But I like to think that I was at work for a reason today--more than for an observation meeting.  Every time I go into work thinking I don't want to be there, something happens that pulls me back in.

Tonight I went to Wendy’s to see my kid. I saw her struggling. She’s new, and to be honest, she doesn’t really ever move with a sense of urgency anyways. I saw the long line of people, who had all probably had long days or were going in to start their long nights, waiting painstakingly yet patiently at the fast food place. I heard her coworker lose patience, correct her in front of customers, and remind her that she wanted to leave 15 minutes ago. (You better believeee I cut her my meanest teacher look for talking to my student that way.) I heard her manager use her name in a tone that I know I use too when kids aren’t doing what I’ve asked. But when I stepped up to order and she realized who I was she said, “You really came.” 

This job has tested me more than a Virginia student during SOL season. Today sucked. The kids had four days off and I thought they would come back ready for some routine and stability. NOPE. I planned a lesson I knew my kids needed, all for them to complain to the high heavens (or refuse to do it.) I incorporated a few things my administrator suggested in my last observation; the kids literally acted like they had never been in school before and couldn’t read. My nice class was mean. I called home on five kids; one of their parents told me, “I don’t care.” Somebody ate almost all of my candy (even though it WAS just the decoy jar of crummy candy, but still.) My good colored pencils and markers got trashed and none of them got put back in the right boxes, probably in an effort to show just how much they really disliked today’s lesson.

Despite the frustration, I will still be there at the games, plays, and I think I probably have to go to Wendy’s every shift this kid works just incase someone decides that they want to have an opinion that also happens to be rude. But I’ll be there, because that, “You really came,” hit me in all the feels.

It's an automatic call log because you use it just for work and all those text messages are saved in one place. I had one parent who was getting abusive so I switched the conversation to text messaging (for their ""convenience"") to keep records. I just sent out a note at the beginning of the year with my number and telling my parents I preferred to text because it is easier on them sometimes and it can provide a reminder for them of the conversation and to let me know if they preferred not to. I had parents who never returned phone calls but would return a text in 30 minutes. Go figure. 
   
I kept the app icon next to my phone icon for handy access. The great thing is if a parent calls you they have to say their name and Google announces it. So you know who you are talking to or who you wish to ignore at that point in time.  
  
The best feature is the do not disturb feature. You can turn it on at any time.

It's an automatic call log because you use it just for work and all those text messages are saved in one place. I had one parent who was getting abusive so I switched the conversation to text messaging (for their ""convenience"") to keep records. I just sent out a note at the beginning of the year with my number and telling my parents I preferred to text because it is easier on them sometimes and it can provide a reminder for them of the conversation and to let me know if they preferred not to. I had parents who never returned phone calls but would return a text in 30 minutes. Go figure. 
   
I kept the app icon next to my phone icon for handy access. The great thing is if a parent calls you they have to say their name and Google announces it. So you know who you are talking to or who you wish to ignore at that point in time.  
  
The best feature is the do not disturb feature. You can turn it on at any time. 
  
Set up a Google Voice number if you don't have one. They are handy. We shouldn't be giving parents our phone numbers when this is available. You just need a Gmail account and then ask the Google how to set up a Google Voice account.",294,compound,0.9654,2019

The post &amp; video state that the child was lost 3 times. First off it seems like it's kinda sorty click-baity but not entirely inaccurate according to the story.

Link to news story: https://www.ajc.com/news/local/father-tirade-over-girl-left-behind-prompts-school-apology/RQGtJnSm1LgLgrvhyVfz4H/

Basically the little kindergartner girl missed her bus 3 times over the course of the school year. The clickbait title makes it seem like she just wandered out of school ground on her own; no she just missed her bus a bunch of times. In this particular instance, her brother was aware of her being missing and informed an adult to wait for her, but the bus still left.

Parent was obviously upset (and rightfully so), and the school seems to have tried to pull the ""we're out at 4PM, please come get them by this time"" card. Technically yes the school is out at 4PM, but we usually have qualified admins/teachers drive kids if necessary.

___

I don't know about all of you, but this happens a lot more than we would like at our school. Kids ask to go to the bathroom or just aren't paying attention during bus dismissal time. They miss the bus and we kinda have to cross our fingers that the parents are going to be both available and understanding.

Recently we had a few kids intentionally lie to us that their mom was picking them up. Like, these kids were supposed to ride the bus but skipped the bus to play with an athletic club after school. They told us they had permission to stay after school &amp; mom was picking them up, so we let them stay. The mom was not informed and was wondering why her kids didn't show up on the bus. Welp, it's because your kids are manipulative undisciplined assholes who think they can do what they want without consequences.

I really hate working bus duty, but it's stuff like this that I'm always afraid of.

The teachers have a right to a social life and be done with work on time, and they also shouldn't have to be a personal caretaker for irresponsible students.

I got a parent angry at me! A kid was sleeping in my class so after several times asking him to wake up and pick his head up (and he wouldn’t), I dropped a book on a desk. The parent emailed me after school, replying to an old email of mine explaining how he was being disrespectful in class. Her opening line was “now who’s being disrespectful?” then went on to say how she wanted a meeting ASAP. So badly I want to go in there and start the meeting off with “I’m sorry I was disrespectful and disrupted your child’s nap.” (This is high school btw for context).

As a teacher, when a kid tells you that they are on a sports team, you go to the games. When they are in the school play, you get the ticket and sit front row. So when a kid tells you they’ve got a job at Wendy’s? You better be getting food there. (We all know you eat that junk anyways.) 

Tonight I went to Wendy’s to see my kid. I saw her struggling. She’s new, and to be honest, she doesn’t really ever move with a sense of urgency anyways. I saw the long line of people, who had all probably had long days or were going in to start their long nights, waiting painstakingly yet patiently at the fast food place. I heard her coworker lose patience, correct her in front of customers, and remind her that she wanted to leave 15 minutes ago. (You better believeee I cut her my meanest teacher look for talking to my student that way.) I heard her manager use her name in a tone that I know I use too when kids aren’t doing what I’ve asked. But when I stepped up to order and she realized who I was she said, “You really came.” 

This job has tested me more than a Virginia student during SOL season. Today sucked. The kids had four days off and I thought they would come back ready for some routine and stability. NOPE. I planned a lesson I knew my kids needed, all for them to complain to the high heavens (or refuse to do it.) I incorporated a few things my administrator suggested in my last observation; the kids literally acted like they had never been in school before and couldn’t read. My nice class was mean. I called home on five kids; one of their parents told me, “I don’t care.” Somebody ate almost all of my candy (even though it WAS just the decoy jar of crummy candy, but still.) My good colored pencils and markers got trashed and none of them got put back in the right boxes, probably in an effort to show just how much they really disliked today’s lesson.

Despite the frustration, I will still be there at the games, plays, and I think I probably have to go to Wendy’s every shift this kid works just incase someone decides that they want to have an opinion that also happens to be rude. But I’ll be there, because that, “You really came,” hit me in all the feels.

All evening my phone has been dinging with notifications.  I'm delighted because those little turds are stuck at home doing the Cornell notes they should have done six weeks ago while I get to go out and have a shrimp dinner and see a movie with my husband. 

Will they learn next quarter?  Probably not, but seeing them panic when crunch time hits gives me a savage, sadistic pleasure. ",369,compound,-0.4621,2019

He then said, “I just wanted to meet you because your name has come up in almost every single interview the past two days.” Apparently, they asked our students questions like “what teacher do you go to when you need support?” and “who is your role model?” and “what has been your favorite class” and most of them said me!!

I have a 7 month old and have been pumping regularly at work since returning from maternity leave.

While not completely hidden, they are stored discreetly enough that students *should* know these items are not for student use. (Though what an 8th grader might want with a Medela flange escapes me)

Cue 8th grade boy, heretofore 8GB, who has walked in after lunch directly through a mud puddle. He walks back to the sink, hoists his foot up onto the edge, and rips off about half a roll of paper towels to clean his shoes of every last speck and smudge. 

In the seconds it takes me to reach the back of my crowded classroom to intervene, he has grabbed the bottle brush and is now using it to clean the soles of his shoes. The damage is done - making a mental note to buy a new one on the way home...

Since when is women’s self-esteem politically debatable?? Feeling defeated by the whole situation, and I guess I just wanted to rant. Maybe I was wrong, but when the outcome was a room full of girls feeling beautiful and powerful, it really doesn’t feel like I was. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. ",401,compound,0.9825,2019

I was a good teacher before with quantifiable student success and a reputation of being moderately difficult yet understanding and good-humored. The general consensus among my workplace confidants is that I am now targeted by our new principal because, 1) I don't fit the Southern Baptist, SEC-loving, pink-and-teal-wearing mould of our community, and 2)  I'm soft-spoken, reserved, and easy to bully. But the reason doesn't matter.

Because of this high-stakes year full of not only extremely high expectations (differentiate every lesson for each of my 93 students,  incorporate multi-media resources each day, DOK level all questions, submit lesson plans two weeks in advance, get 18-year-old students to read and understand Medieval texts sometime between school, work, and baseball practice, etc.) but also less planning time (observations are frequent and are accompanied by meetings that eat up my entired planning period), I have abandoned my duties in the care of my adored terminally ill mother, any semblance of free time or sense of humor, and leave 90% of the housework and cooking to my A+ husband. 

I've also become dependent on the gross over-use of Vynase to support the 60+ hours I spend at work and the remaining 10+ hours in which I toil at home each week.

But I'm a great fucking teacher. Fantastic even. Every piece of paper I hand out is color-coded, hole-punched, and artfully crafted by yours truly. My room is absolutely gorgeous. It sparkles with my nature-loving, Birkenstock-wearing style executed with sharp, modern functionality. My two large white boards impress with intricately written anchor notes. My daily agendas are synched to the T with lesson plans. Welcome to the well-oiled machine that is British Literature in room B 101.

So thank you to all the ball busting, micromanaging, fear mongering principals out there with nothing better to do than push teachers to their very limits. Enjoy your 150k a year. Have mirth when we drag in each day with grey pallor and thinning hair. Find joy in our panicking nerves as we register the sound of your keys wrestling to unlock our classroom door. Keep on expecting --demanding-- glistening perfection every second of every day and, by golly, you'll get it.

The general consensus among my workplace confidants is that I am now targeted by our new principal because, 1) I don't fit the Southern Baptist, SEC-loving, pink-and-teal-wearing mould of our community, and 2)  I'm soft-spoken, reserved, and easy to bully. But the reason doesn't matter.

Because of this high-stakes year full of not only extremely high expectations (differentiate every lesson for each of my 93 students,  incorporate multi-media resources each day, DOK level all questions, submit lesson plans two weeks in advance, get 18-year-old students to read and understand Medieval texts sometime between school, work, and baseball practice, etc.) but also less planning time (observations are frequent and are accompanied by meetings that eat up my entired planning period), I have abandoned my duties in the care of my adored terminally ill mother, any semblance of free time or sense of humor, and leave 90% of the housework and cooking to my A+ husband. 

I've also become dependent on the gross over-use of Vynase to support the 60+ hours I spend at work and the remaining 10+ hours in which I toil at home each week.

But I'm a great fucking teacher. Fantastic even. Every piece of paper I hand out is color-coded, hole-punched, and artfully crafted by yours truly. My room is absolutely gorgeous. It sparkles with my nature-loving, Birkenstock-wearing style executed with sharp, modern functionality. My two large white boards impress with intricately written anchor notes. My daily agendas are synched to the T with lesson plans. Welcome to the well-oiled machine that is British Literature in room B 101.

So thank you to all the ball busting, micromanaging, fear mongering principals out there with nothing better to do than push teachers to their very limits. Enjoy your 150k a year. Have mirth when we drag in each day with grey pallor and thinning hair. Find joy in our panicking nerves as we register the sound of your keys wrestling to unlock our classroom door. Keep on expecting --demanding-- glistening perfection every second of every day and, by golly, you'll get it. ",411,compound,0.9972,2019

I'm a high school junior, and recently i've been reflecting a lot on my time in the school system, especially since i only have a year and a half left before college (wow!). I just really wanted to thank all of you for what you do every day. I know it isn't always easy, but teachers really do shape the future. I've been impacted by so many amazing teachers in my educational career, and I just wanted to say thank you...

Thank you to my first grade teacher, for giving me a love of learning and sharing her passion for math. (Bonus points for teaching us about factorials before we even knew how to do long division!) She really encouraged us to go above and beyond the standards we were taught, and it made a huge difference to me.

Thank you to my elementary school music teacher, for being the reason I chose to explore music. Music will always be a part of my life, and the friends and memories I made through music will always be some of my favorites.

Thank you to my seventh grade English teacher, for letting me realize that my work can stand out if I put effort and creativity into it, and for helping me improve my writing so, so much.

Thank you to my eighth grade science teacher, for letting me explore my interest in science, and for remembering me by name  even a couple years after I was in his class.

Thank you to my freshman math teacher, for believing in me and encouraging me to keep taking higher-level math classes. If she hadn't recommended me to take a higher level of math as a sophomore, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Thank you to my freshman history teacher, because even though some kids in the class made fun of her, I know she was trying her best to keep us engaged, and for being happy to give me advice even after I was her student.

Thank you to my sophomore english teacher, for finally making Shakespeare interesting, and for encouraging me to be creative in my work. She made creative writing better than any other teacher I've had.

Thank you to my orchestra director, for seeing herself in me, and for showing me the emotional value of music.

Thank you to both of my chemistry teachers, for helping me fall in love with the subject, and being all-around super nice people.

Thank you to my current English teacher, for being so kind and understanding, and such an engaging lecturer. I look forward to her class every day, and she seems to make the long class period take half the time.

Thank you to my current math teacher, for being passionate about both math and teaching. She is the reason I'm finally starting to like math again.

Thank you to one of my club sponsors, for believing in me and what I'm capable of. In a club with hundreds of students, he knew me by name, and always encouraged me.

Thank you to one of my other club sponsors, for making me feel welcome when I was the ""new kid"", and for being so passionate about what she did. Sadly, she left us far too soon. Her passing has inspired me to share my appreciation with others, because I never got the chance to tell her how much I appreciate her.&lt;3

Finally, thank **you** for being so dedicated to your profession that you're here right now. I'm sure your students appreciate you, and they're lucky to have you as a teacher! Teaching really is a noble profession, and even though it's not what I plan to do, some of my teachers have definitely inspired me to consider it.

Mom emailed me to thank me for introducing her student to a topic they are now very curious about. 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I teach 6th grade Geography. 

&amp;#x200B;

Starting this school year, I have had my geography students present Current Events every Friday.  They can pick any event that is school appropriate (so basically nothing violent or Fortnite related as thats all they would present about), interests them, and has happened in the two week span before their assigned presentation date.  They are required to fill out a worksheet, which translates nicely to the Powerpoint template I give them to help with their oral presentation.  Presentations usually last 1-2 minutes and students can ask questions about the event afterward.  The students were first very wary of putting themselves out there, but now they all want to be the first to present each quarter/day.  I have also had some awesome presentations on everything from VR being used in medical schools to help train surgeons to a local sports story on a female football player scoring her school's first touchdown by a female.  I even think there's a contest going on between my 5th and 6th periods to see who could not repeat new stories in an entire quarter (as in no two students do the same news article in the same class).  

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to yesterday.  One of my students did their CE on the measles outbreak in the Philippines and was able to give some personal background on it as they are Filipino and have family members who still live there.  They talked about the statistics of the outbreak and how measles could be potentially fatal to some people.  They talked about how the government is trying really hard to get people vaccinated and how it lessens your chance of catching the disease.  They did a great job and kept it pretty factual  (save the ""Hey I have family there and its kind of scary for my family"" piece, which was put into a how does this impact you/ the world section).  After the student's presentation was over, one of my more outgoing students raised their hand.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Uh, Ms. Charm \_city\_princess, if there's a vaccine available, why don't people just get it?  I think I heard of this measles thing happening in Washington too.  If there's something out there that might protect you, why don't people get it?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing our student population and some of the beliefs they come from, I knew I had to tread lightly on this particular topic.  I explained to my class that while yes, there is a vaccine available to help prevent these types of things from happening, some people do not get vaccinated for a few reasons such as illness, religious background, or personal beliefs. I tried my damnest to not let my personal beliefs get in to my little mini lesson, but I did mention that as a kid I was vaccinated ( and thats how we found out I do NOT do well with needles and I pass out each time; they thought that was hilarious as I am seen as a pretty 'tough but loving' teacher).  I also explained that I do have some family members and friends who cannot get vaccinated due to illness that prevent them from getting vaccines themselves and to help prevent them from getting sick, we make sure to keep our vaccines up to date/ get the flu shot every year.  We brought the discussion to an end and moved on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly forgot about that mini lesson until I received an email from that same student's mom last night/ early this morning.  Their mom emailed me thanking me for making their student curious about how vaccines work, what they are used for, and the debate surrounding them.  Mom further went on to explain that she is a nurse who works in a PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) and how she interacts with both sides of the issue at work.  She was pleasantly surprised her student came home and began ""researching"" the vaccine issue, which spurred her student to have a conversation with her.  She thanked me for teaching the way I do and helping her student become curious about a topic that they genuinely now seem very invested in.  

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, her email was an awesome glimmer of praise in a week that honestly was an uphill battle on a few fronts.  It also helped me remember that even though I might touch on a topic for a brief period of time, I could potentially spark a student's interest in it for a lifetime.

I thought things would be better, but my failure rate remains high.

I feel like I grade very generously.

Homework is simple. I ask them to read one section of the textbook each week, and copy the definitions. I also have them watch a video that is less than 10 minutes long. Homework grades are basically completion. Classwork too. Really the only thing that isn't completion are tests and quizzes. They are weighted very heavily in accordance with school policy but I balance that by also including lab work in that grading category.  I did a data analysis today (I'm real big on data) and the assessments category is actually the highest scoring of the three.

What it comes down to is students aren't doing the work. I try to plan engaging lessons, and I am told often that my lessons are creative and hands-on. But somehow I am failing to inspire about half my kids to do their work. A decent chunk of these kids are failing other classes too, but there are several who are failing my class alone.

My class is the only science class in the state to be a tested subject. Every other core subject has two tests, two chances to earn ""points"" in that subject area that count toward graduation. In science, they get one. Our school science data rests on me alone. And the test is tough. Things are on that test that I didn't learn until college. I must maintain high standards. So the content is difficult, but not impossible. There is not a single student who failed my class last quarter (or ever) due to assessments alone. 

I met with every failing student before winter break. I communicate with parents via email and phone. I collect their work by hand so they have to tell me if they didn't do it. I accept late work (up to a point).

What am I doing wrong? I want to fix this, and I am truly at a loss as to how. I feel like it's my fault because my failure rate is the highest at my school. There are others that sometimes get close, but it's been me this year consistently at the top as each quarter closes.

The kids are failing because there is no accountability. You do not let us fail them and they know it so they do not try. Your scores are low on state testing because you falsify data and bully teachers into passing them. 

Our director of instruction has been through six secretaries in two years!! She abuses them out the door!!! Our turn over rate is insane and that is with them refusing to accept transfers and trying to block them! (No idea how they can but they do.) I got told I do not have good relationships with students because I am white teaching in title one even though I have had no write ups in two years! Because I work on relationships and know it would be a waste too. 

My anxiety and depression are attacking me lately. I tried so hard to be strong but I do not know how I will survive until May like this. Everyday is some new rule, expectation, pressure. I cannot even put into words how much stuff has happened and what they do. We have a group that meets every other week to just talk and support each other. Texas unions are not super strong but we are reporting and yet they get away with this abuse daily. 

I am so tired. I love teaching but I can barely get out of bed and yes I am in therapy and I do take meds but the constant teacher abuse is getting to me.

I'm originally from a very white conservative town.  I teach in a very diverse NYC school.  It's my first year and the admin is super supportive, co-workers are super helpful and great mentors,  and I really enjoy teaching. 

I wanted to teach in a diverse area in a Title 1 school because I felt like I could probably relate to the students more than I could relate to students where I'm from. 

Despite growing up in white middle class suburbia,  my parents struggled to pay bills and regularly accepted food donations to keep us fed.  I survived a violent crime at a young age and have dealt with clinical depression and PTSD for the majority of my life.  I've had to be financially independent since i graduated high school. My parents do not accept me for being gay. My dad is verbally and emotionally abusive but stopped talking to me for the past couple of years because of our differing views.

Obviously being white I can't relate to the students' experiences with systemic racism,  and I don't pretend to understand what racism feels like. And I don't know what my students who are immigrants have gone through or are going through either. But I can at least relate to surface level discrimination (as a woman in science and as a lesbian in general).  



Well as a first year teacher,  I didn't start off with strong classroom management and I try to be very understanding and kind to the students.  So naturally they walked all over me, took complete advantage of me,  and as soon as I tried to apply what I've learned and get classroom management under control,  they lashed out. 

One particularly tough student calls me a racist for asking the class generally to behave, acting like I'm addressing only him by name. During a test this week he stormed out of the room and declared in the hallway that I'm racist because I asked EVERYONE to stop talking during the test.  He is the oldest kid in the school and the younger students look up to him,  so they have started to tell me that they feel targeted as well if I tell them that I need them to be quiet during a test.


And these kids try to gaslight me (challenge my reality to drive me crazy) every day.  I ask them not to talk while I'm talking,  they say they weren't talking. I say I saw you talking and I need you to stop talking. They say no, I wasn't talking. I tell them their classmates deserve a quite testing space and ask them to be mindful of their peers,  and they tell me they don't need a quiet space. They have no regard for other people. 


I thought I could relate to these kids,  but I just can't understand them.  I had a tough life growing up,  I thought at least some of them would have had similarly tough lives  and would have some level of maturity.  But it's like I'm teaching the third grade most days. I watch them throw a water bottle and reprimand them and they tell me they didn't throw it!

I always felt ostracized growing up having such a different perspective than my peers and family,  and I feel totally ostracized by my students now. They don't accept me and since they keep playing the race card it feels like they just don't like me because I'm white and they see me as not like them. 

They operate on the principle that everyone,  including teachers,  have to earn their respect. I try to show interest in their interests,  I check in on them when they seem to be having a bad day,  I'm there for them every day,  and I try very hard  to be as fair as possible in everything. But I have been unable to earn their respect. What can I do?

Thank goodness I have the next week off for mid writer recess because I've been so distraught over this lately.

So I've been teaching for 6 years now, the last 4 being in a charter, and I'm tired. I'm not leaving because of the kids. I love them. I'm leaving because I want to be in a union, and I believe in my heart of hearts that charters are being used not as sites of innovation, but as tools with which the government and private actors can a) de-legitimize the teaching profession and unions, b) re-segregate and protect the current segregation of schools and thus white supremacy, and c) end public financing of schools.

So, first chance I got, I accepted an offer to teach in a public magnet school yesterday, and they want me to start ASAP.  So that's good.

2. Transitioning out (2 weeks notice? Drop them like a bad habit?)
3. Helping new students adjust (teaching freshpeople, their old teacher was moved into an admin role)

I have made complaints about her to our AP but I think the AP is just placating me and nothing will get done. It is breeding resentment in my dept with everyone else working hard with large class sizes while she collects a fat paycheck and does very little work to actually teach the kids. Any ideas how I should approach this? My principal does not seem responsive to this as well.

I’m an IS. There is a 14 year old student who has severe ADHD, but his parents will not medicate due to other health conditions. These other health impairments lead to the student having many, MANY absences, and missing a ton of work. It’s gotten to the point that he is only responsible for completing what he is present for. Yes, his IEP says he doesn’t get homework. The problem is a lot of the behavior is crying wolf. But the parents want us to allow it. In other words, when he wants out of class, he just has to say, “I don’t feel good,” and goes to take a nap. This might sound harsh, but after spending 500 minutes with him per week, I’ve gotten to know what his illness looks like vs. when he’s faking. For instance, he’s doing cartwheels in the hallway, then the second academic work is expected, he’s too sick. 

I just got an email after report cards went home that said, “How could you let him fail English? Why didn’t you tell me he was failing! It is YOUR JOB to make sure he doesn’t fail!” 

Let’s rewind this a bit. 

1. I emailed the parent to let them know I thought he would need summer school, and I laid out a schedule. From what his old IS told me, the family is not interested and prefers to take the left over scholarship money to pay the private school tuition (leaving support staff short a paycheck). It’s not cool, so I’m both trying to prevent that from happening and offering a way to ensure the student gets at least some of the massive amount of curriculum they’re missing by volunteering my summer vacation. 

2. I bumped up the schedule of his IEP meeting because I have a LOT of concerns. In my district, a student literally has to be failing a subject before you can address it as a concern (kind of like... you can’t arrest someone before they commit a crime even if you know it’s going to happen). Currently, he doesn’t have an English IEP goal for me to address.

3. I spoke to the parent in December about some grade concerns and laid out a potential intervention (he’s only been to class once since then to implement the intervention). His gened and homeroom teachers have also reached out to the family with concerns about individual assignments. 

4. I don’t even have the gradebook for English! I took 3 grades for this kid last semester (and put in extremely detailed notes), while the gened teacher took the rest. In other words, I can’t even look at the grade to say, “Hey, this kid is failing. What should we do?” On top of that, students are responsible for checking the online gradebook once a week. Teachers are supposed to bring me grade concerns (I never heard from the gened teacher about this grade other than he wasn’t doing well on a variety of assignments because of work refusal — not even academic, just straight up refusal). 


But this is all a surprise that’s my fault?? What should I have done differently? The parent is so pissed off that we’re having an admin and team meeting with them this week. Yaaaaay.

I am a first year Art teacher at a fabulous elementary school. I am writing in to solicit your help with a problem that, it seems, no one at my school has a clear answer for. I greatly appreciate the time you take to read this and any guidance you may have for me!

Roughly once a week, I see this particular class of 5th graders for a 45 minute period. The students are, for the most part, very sweet and excited about Art. However, there are three boys that, because of their disruptive behavior, are basically holding the rest of the class hostage. I’ll call them B, D and T.

B, D and T all seem to follow the same behavioral pattern. My policy has always been that the students line up “Toes on Tape” outside of my classroom, and then again inside my classroom. “Toes on Tape” is a school policy that means their feet are physically touching a duck tape line on the floor, they are facing forward and quiet. In my room, the whole class must be Toes on Tape before they are dismissed to their seats. B, D and T need constant ‘reminders’ about this, starting class on a sour note almost every time. Whether they’re dancing, touching a neighbor, deliberately not touching the tape, laughing, talking to each other, muttering to themselves...etc. I give them reminders, warnings, etc. Meanwhile, the whole class is waiting on them, as usual.

Next, I direct the students to gather around a table so I can show them the demonstration for the day’s activity. Throughout my demonstration, B, D or T (or sometimes all three!) are being disruptive by - same thing - touching their neighbor, making comments, noises, laughing, suddenly needing to leave the circle to take a walk about...etc. I reprimand them. If they require more than a few ‘reminders’ I send them to their seats so I can speak to them later. That in itself is a struggle. “What?” “What did I do??” or my favorite... “I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING!” Suddenly, even though they themselves, the whole class and I were witness to their poor choices, they melt into an argumentative, victimized puddle. I ignore them, and finish my demonstration. 

I call them up individually (because as I said, sometimes it’s all three of them!) and speak to them about their behavior. At this point in our relationship, we are long past the “Hey, what’s going on? You seem to be having an off day!” conversation that normally works with my one-time offenders. This happens, again, usually with all three of them, every time they come to Art. I tell them, “If you interrupt my class again, you are making a choice to leave my room.” This conversation is always a catalyst for the victimization drama. The usual responses ensue. 

Arguing is a second offense that sends them to a timeout on my rug so they can cool off. Again, usual responses...blah blah blah. Sometimes the responses escalate to something like “I’m not your pet!” or another favorite, “Well, if that’s the way it’s gonna be! If it’s really gonna be about the color of our skin....” Recently, they’ve been outright refusing to sit where I tell them to, whether it be in a chair or on my rug. When they refuse to follow my directions, I tell them, they are making a choice to be escorted out of my room. They dig in their heels, and this week, I had all three of them escorted out. One by one. 

I must also note...disciplining them eats up all of my class time. I literally can’t do my job when I’m busy putting out simultaneous fires. 

This has been my biggest challenge this year. I might be a newbie, but I think I can handle a lot of classroom behaviors. What I don’t know how to handle, and what makes me feel incredibly helpless, is this chip-on-my-shoulder, victimization routine. As you may have assumed from the skin color comment, I am a White woman and all three boys are Black. I don’t think I have to defend myself, but let me just say it: I’m not out to get them. I love my students, and honestly, I hate sending them out of my room. I want Art class to be a time of self expression and joy. Not a bitter 45 minutes of disruption met with discipline, resulting in me kicking anyone out. 

I am lucky to have the principal on my side. So far, she has backed me up on all of my discipline decisions. I have had conferences between her and all three of the boys’ mothers. Some have been productive, others have not. I have a conference with B and his mother this week. With that being said, however, the principal hasn’t exactly offered me a concrete solution for how to fix this massive problem. 

The counselor has spoken to them and believes I should heed the boys’ requests they gave her for my class. Yes, requests. This includes being able to stand in class, being able to explain how they feel, be reminded of expectations in a “calm” way, and be able to sit together at the end of class if they remain on task for 20 minutes. 

Being able to stand in class is a no-go considering they can’t stay focused from their seats without turning 180 degrees and yelling across the room at each other. Giving them more mobility sounds counter-productive. Being able to explain how they feel, I know from experience, in reality is arguing that eats up my entire class between the three of them. The giving them calm reminders request is a little comical, considering I give them too many ‘reminders,’ in my opinion. And being able to sit together sounds like a recipe for disaster. Ideally, sure, I’d love to offer that reward. But not with these three.

Adding another layer to all this...the counselor believes this is a “cultural” difference that I need to respect. My classroom expectations are CLEAR, consistent and certainly fair. I will not lower my standards for them, that would be a disservice to them.

The only idea I’ve been able to come up with, and the counselor suggested, is perhaps I could create a visual wherein they could see the amount of times I need to give each of them a ‘reminder.’ However, this doesn’t deal with the arguing, you’re-out-to-get-me mentality...or the outright lying. 

Trying to build a relationship with them? I can’t see it happening in a 45 minute class period so long as I’m stopping every three sentences to correct them. And it’s not for lack of trying. Even during individual work time...I’m busy putting out those fires. Outside of class? I’m lucky if i a get a “Good Morning” in response.

I have been wanting to post my first year story here for sometime, so if you are willing to go along for the ride, that would be awesome. I am a second year, high school English teacher, so I have not been doing this for long, but I hope my story can help some other first year/student teachers. My first year teaching was the worst year of my life; I almost quit teaching. I am SO glad I didn't. So if you would like to hear my story, buckle up for the ride.

&amp;#x200B;

After student teaching (which was amazing), I started working at a lower income school. I was aware of the job I was going into, but I am a very optimistic person and went in with a positive attitude and with bright eyes. The place I got a job, let's call it T, was an hour away from my parent's house. I was staying with them to save some money my first year. The drive was not bad, it was in the country, so it was a pretty scene. T was not so pretty. My classroom had bare, concrete walls, no windows throughout the school, and it basically felt like a prison. I tried my best to brighten the room, but it still looked pretty dim. I have a vitamin D deficiency, so no sunlight was not good for me. Again, I tried to make the best of it.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworkers were awesome! They helped me out the best they could, but at the end of the day, it was all on me. Now let us get to the main problem: the students. I knew they were going to be difficult, being where we were. But I am fun and young, so students their age usually like me. Man was I wrong. For one, most of them missed their old teacher that they had last year because they never did any work. But I was not about to give up. Throughout the year, it became harder and harder to be positive. They would yell at me, I could not get them to settle down, they would leave class without permission. There was just a complete lack of discipline. I do not like to yell in my class, but even with me being 5'3 and 115 pounds, I have the voice of a football coach using a megaphone. So when I yelled for the first time, I saw the light go from their eyes. That worked for awhile. That was until the worst incident of my life happened.

&amp;#x200B;

A student was added to my class that came from the ""bad kids"" school. Again, I was positive and was told by other teachers to just let him do his thing. However, being a strong willed person, I was not about to let that happen. So one day I was teaching and he would not get off the phone. I told him multiple times to put it away or I was going to take it up. He refused, so I went to his desk, took up his phone, and put it in my filing cabinet by my desk. Now my desk was in the corner of the room and the filing cabinet was next to the wall. This 17-year-old, 5'8 boy, came up to my desk, put his hands on me, pushed me against the wall (hard), pushed my filing cabinet, took his phone, and ran out of the room. I was in shock, my students were in shock, I did not know what to do. Never in my wildest nightmares did I think a student would put their hands on me. One of my good students got one of the coaches across the hall to get the assistant principal. He had me make a report and told me to take the next class period off. He got the student from his next class and he was sent back to the other school.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not okay after that, I wanted to quit but I couldn't. I ended up going into the deep depression and had PTSD symptoms. I stopped disciplining my students and basically teaching them all together. My principal was concerned for me and I told him that I would be leaving at the end of the year. I could not handle being there anymore. My room began to feel like an actual prison. A month after the incident, they let the student back into the school, not my class, but right next door. The first time I saw him I had a panic attack. So, at the end of the year, I quit and never looked back. I decided I did not want to teach anymore. I couldn't handle something like that happening again. But I knew I had to work so I planned on subbing or tutoring until I found something else I wanted to do. All I ever wanted to do was teach. I love teaching, I love working with high school students, I just couldn't do it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

But that is not what fate had for me. As I was getting my oil changed, I saw a commercial for virtual learning. I applied that day, got an interview, and got the job that week. And I have never been happier. I love my job! I love my fellow teachers! I love my students. I work from home and get to stay home with my pets, but I get to do what I love. I found my love for teaching again. I never thought I would be able to do that again. My spirit was completely crushed, but I found it again through these students who need me because they can't do normal public school. I was able to stay home and deal with my depression and PTSD in a safe environment. It has been the best thing that ever happened to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been wanting to post my first year story here for sometime, so if you are willing to go along for the ride, that would be awesome. I am a second year, high school English teacher, so I have not been doing this for long, but I hope my story can help some other first year/student teachers. My first year teaching was the worst year of my life; I almost quit teaching. I am SO glad I didn't. So if you would like to hear my story, buckle up for the ride.

&amp;#x200B;

After student teaching (which was amazing), I started working at a lower income school. I was aware of the job I was going into, but I am a very optimistic person and went in with a positive attitude and with bright eyes. The place I got a job, let's call it T, was an hour away from my parent's house. I was staying with them to save some money my first year. The drive was not bad, it was in the country, so it was a pretty scene. T was not so pretty. My classroom had bare, concrete walls, no windows throughout the school, and it basically felt like a prison. I tried my best to brighten the room, but it still looked pretty dim. I have a vitamin D deficiency, so no sunlight was not good for me. Again, I tried to make the best of it.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworkers were awesome! They helped me out the best they could, but at the end of the day, it was all on me. Now let us get to the main problem: the students. I knew they were going to be difficult, being where we were. But I am fun and young, so students their age usually like me. Man was I wrong. For one, most of them missed their old teacher that they had last year because they never did any work. But I was not about to give up. Throughout the year, it became harder and harder to be positive. They would yell at me, I could not get them to settle down, they would leave class without permission. There was just a complete lack of discipline. I do not like to yell in my class, but even with me being 5'3 and 115 pounds, I have the voice of a football coach using a megaphone. So when I yelled for the first time, I saw the light go from their eyes. That worked for awhile. That was until the worst incident of my life happened.

&amp;#x200B;

A student was added to my class that came from the ""bad kids"" school. Again, I was positive and was told by other teachers to just let him do his thing. However, being a strong willed person, I was not about to let that happen. So one day I was teaching and he would not get off the phone. I told him multiple times to put it away or I was going to take it up. He refused, so I went to his desk, took up his phone, and put it in my filing cabinet by my desk. Now my desk was in the corner of the room and the filing cabinet was next to the wall. This 17-year-old, 5'8 boy, came up to my desk, put his hands on me, pushed me against the wall (hard), pushed my filing cabinet, took his phone, and ran out of the room. I was in shock, my students were in shock, I did not know what to do. Never in my wildest nightmares did I think a student would put their hands on me. One of my good students got one of the coaches across the hall to get the assistant principal. He had me make a report and told me to take the next class period off. He got the student from his next class and he was sent back to the other school.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not okay after that, I wanted to quit but I couldn't. I ended up going into the deep depression and had PTSD symptoms. I stopped disciplining my students and basically teaching them all together. My principal was concerned for me and I told him that I would be leaving at the end of the year. I could not handle being there anymore. My room began to feel like an actual prison. A month after the incident, they let the student back into the school, not my class, but right next door. The first time I saw him I had a panic attack. So, at the end of the year, I quit and never looked back. I decided I did not want to teach anymore. I couldn't handle something like that happening again. But I knew I had to work so I planned on subbing or tutoring until I found something else I wanted to do. All I ever wanted to do was teach. I love teaching, I love working with high school students, I just couldn't do it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

But that is not what fate had for me. As I was getting my oil changed, I saw a commercial for virtual learning. I applied that day, got an interview, and got the job that week. And I have never been happier. I love my job! I love my fellow teachers! I love my students. I work from home and get to stay home with my pets, but I get to do what I love. I found my love for teaching again. I never thought I would be able to do that again. My spirit was completely crushed, but I found it again through these students who need me because they can't do normal public school. I was able to stay home and deal with my depression and PTSD in a safe environment. It has been the best thing that ever happened to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are a first year teacher, or a student teacher. From the bottom of my heart, keep going! If you feel lost and don't think you can do this, I am telling you, you can! You will find your school, your tribe, your students. I would never have found mine if I gave up. One twist of fate kept me going. If you love this profession, truly love teaching, then keep going! Do not give up! We got this guys! If you have stayed with me this long, I thank you with my whole spirit. I finally got my story out and it feels amazing! ",462,compound,0.999,2019

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my third year of teaching and have worked in two districts. I have always known that being a classroom teacher wasn't my ""endgame,"" but I'm thinking about leaving earlier than anticipated. This year especially, I have felt really bogged down mentally and emotionally due to work. Every time I talk about feeling this way, I always get comments like ""Oh, you'll have those years,"" but it has been every year for me. I am tired of being what is basically a human punching bag everyday for 180 days of the year. I am tired of administration that micromanages and doesn't trust me to do my job and new, ever-changing policies that we're expected to fully embrace. (Our current one is competency based education, which I think is great if done right, but we're going to be a pilot district next year with little to no groundwork or even an idea of what we want CBE to look like in our district.) I came to the realization during a conversation the other day that I felt happier in my work as a waitress than I do teaching. I LOVE building relationships with my students and seeing them grow, but I don't know if I can just stay in it ""for the kids"" anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in the application process for a master's in school counseling and have an interview scheduled for the end of the month. However, that program will take 4-5 years of part time classes, and I honestly don't know if I want to teach for four or five more years. I started looking online at job opportunities and found one through a local community college that is the Optional Education Program Coordinator. Essentially, I would be working with area districts who have students who aren't succeeding in the traditional school setting. I would be in charge of managing and coordinating educational plans for these students to get them a diploma/GED, including the evaluation of curriculum and hiring of staff for these alternative settings. This is a huge step up in terms of responsibilities, but is something I'm interested in. The only downside is that they want someone with experience in budget management and grant writing, and that is the one thing that I lack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply for the position? Is a lack of experience in those skills something that could potentially be taught to me by that employer prior to starting, or would you think that's a deal breaker? This is the first large position I've ever considered, so I'm just unsure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I do apply, I worry about them contacting my current district because I have not told anyone that I'm considering leaving. Can I tell the place I'm applying to that they can't contact my current employer, or would that cast a negative light on me? I mostly fear my administration deciding to not renew my contract due to it, which they would be able to do without providing a reason since I do not have tenure yet.

Hi!

I'm a younger teacher and head coach of a mid-sized suburban high school. While I love teaching coaching, and got into it to help students, I've noticed that administrators have a lot of bureaucratic power over things that affect the students' daily lives. One thing I've seen is that deans and administrators just hand down punishments as student discipline instead of listening to the student and deciding the appropriate consequence from there.

For example, one of my athletes suffers from depression and could barely get out of bed for school or practice most days. His consequence for missing school because of his condition? An out of school suspension. So...we punish his truancy by making him not come to school? Ridiculous. I would love to be in a position to suggest or implement more restorative measures.

Anyway, I've been recently thinking of going towards the admin route many more years down the road after I've had more teaching experience. I am currently getting a masters in Diversity and Equity so that I can be better equipped to serve my diverse student body. So do I also need a masters in Administration of Educational leadership in order to be considered for a Dean job? Also would a EdD in one of those be too much just to become a dean?

I'm not a teacher, however, my mom is. She has been having a rough year and I wanted to get some feedback on how to be supportive to her.


Background: She was teaching 6th grade English at a new STEM school, but due to low VAM scores (I might be spelling that wrong), was forced with a few other teachers to change school. The one she was at had changed from a normal school to the STEM focus the year the low scores occurred. She is now at a school that seems to not care about a lot. She's teaching the remedial kids to improve reading/writing. The students first teacher walked out within the first month and supposedly no one knows why or can contact her. They had subs for 3 months, before my mom came in, who hadn't been actually grading them and had been just been giving them A's and letting them do whatever.


The students are literally screaming and yelling at her because she is making them do *actual* work and grading based on real work submitted. She had a whole class (the one bad bad one), except for a few, get F's.... simply because they refuse to do or turn in work. The students are so bad she's having to call administration to have them removed daily - like threatening to kill people and white supremacists stuff bad. The other teachers just shrug and say yeah those kids are terrible and say they do the same thing.



I'm seeing her near tears often and just not want to go to work anymore. I'm worried for her. She is just starting to look dead inside. I know she reached out to find a therapist last week so she could get extra help. She's been teacher for longer than I've been alive (30+ years) and I've never seen her like this, even when she worked inner city.

Now, for most sports teams, it is easy- they meet every day at the same time.  
As for cheer, our schedule is sporadic because it depends on other sports’ games.  For example, fall is easy- we practice Mondays and Wednesdays and then cheer at football games Fridays.  So our “class” is scheduled for those days.  
Now that we are in winter, things are complicated.  Basketball games are not as predictable.  Some weeks they are WF and some weeks they are TR.  If they are WF, then we practice on M and then go to the games WF.  If the games are TR, we will sometimes practice MW if we need to, or sometimes we cancel one or both practices to accommodate the girls’ homework loads.  
I asked the school to allow me to take roll through PowerSchool any day M-F, but not necessarily any day, and assume that if I didn’t take roll, we didn’t meet.  This is sort of possible, but then I could be legally responsible for the students during the times we say we meet but we don’t.  The admin sort of “wink winked” his way through the conversation, trying to lead me to certain ideas of my own but without saying anything that would imply that we were both going against protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

Brief background:

\- I am 23 years old

\- I graduated with a **BA in English - Creative Writing**

\- I taught **English I** at my high school alma mater for one year as part of a volunteer teaching program open to alumni. It is a private school with a great reputation in the city and state. The program only lasts for a year; I could have been rehired, but other candidates who had master's and teaching experience got the 2 jobs over me. The principal was very nice about it and said he would love to see me apply in the future, and I left with a great letter of rec for grad school and with great friends and experience. I currently assist at the school with the drama department and am paid for it.

\- **I am currently enrolled in a graduate program for my MA in English.** I am applying to be a Teacher's Assistant there next year, which will come with a tuition waver and stipend and also more teaching experience to put on my resume. 

\- I chose to not earn my master's degree as an MAT or MeD because I didn't want to take the education courses (I took some in college and also took a Research for Better Teaching course last summer and am mainly interested in continuing to teach in private schools, so certification is important to me but not the *most* important; **I prefer to be strong in my English background).** 

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

In my state, **Louisiana,** I don't have to take the Praxis I because of my composite ACT score (28 overall, with a 35 in English and 34 in literature being my highest scores, but my math and science are in the lower 20's I also scored a 4 on my English AP exams). 

My question is, should I look into preparing for and taking my **Praxis II** test by this summer if I only have one semester of my master's under my belt? Would my scores from undergrad and high school be enough if I buckle down and prepare for the test? Has anyone taken it recently? For my master's degree I will be taking two comprehensive exams (one American and one British) instead of taking one comp and writing a thesis (I don't have any plans on teaching at the college level or earning a PhD). Basically, I was hoping I could start working on my certification now so that I don't wind up spending more time and money on my education. My other plan is just waiting on my certification until after I have earned my master's (May 2020) while hopefully being hired in the private sector to teach (likely without my certification, but I'd love to have everything I could possibly need).

It was physically demanding and I never felt good enough. I'm starting to feel that way with my job and it's not good.

I'm working in the UK but I'm from Canada. This is important because when I planned to become a teacher, it was within the Canadian system and for Canadian secondary (14-18) not UK secondary (11-16). I've been teaching here for the last 2.5 years (1 year at a different school and the last 1.5 at this school) and I struggle to find enjoyment. I feel like I always have to be on the students' cases and that my lessons aren't fun because when I try something fun, behaviour falls apart. I feel like I have to raise my voice too much or shout too much or give detentions too much without any real payoff. I don't feel like I'm doing a good job and the system itself is so boring and ineffective that it seems a waste of time.

But I'm in a foreign country and the prospect of leaving teaching that I know fairly well in order to do something else without any sort of safety net is terrifying. Back home, I have friends and family that could help me if I needed somewhere to stay or whatever.

It was physically demanding and I never felt good enough. I'm starting to feel that way with my job and it's not good.

I'm working in the UK but I'm from Canada. This is important because when I planned to become a teacher, it was within the Canadian system and for Canadian secondary (14-18) not UK secondary (11-16). I've been teaching here for the last 2.5 years (1 year at a different school and the last 1.5 at this school) and I struggle to find enjoyment. I feel like I always have to be on the students' cases and that my lessons aren't fun because when I try something fun, behaviour falls apart. I feel like I have to raise my voice too much or shout too much or give detentions too much without any real payoff. I don't feel like I'm doing a good job and the system itself is so boring and ineffective that it seems a waste of time.

But I'm in a foreign country and the prospect of leaving teaching that I know fairly well in order to do something else without any sort of safety net is terrifying. Back home, I have friends and family that could help me if I needed somewhere to stay or whatever.

He is so hard to control, he gets out of my classroom without telling me, he is disrespectful to me and other kids.

I think I'd make a great teacher who would care about his student's and help them for their future .I didn't overly enjoy any drama of high school but I love learning and teaching/helping others.

I like to think of myself as a pretty smart person, I've always done very well in school, 1460 SAT, and going to a school in Boston currently. I think I'd make a great teacher who would care about his student's and help them for their future .I didn't overly enjoy any drama of high school but I love learning and teaching/helping others. However currently I kind of see myself following my father's footsteps of living to make a lot of $ and putting happiness and peace of mind second. So that's why id like to keep the door to a teaching job open to myself.  The reason im writing this post is because I'm not sure how one goes about being a teacher.

 **Is there a way I can take some classes, or a minor that would put me on track to being a teacher?** I would plan on being an Econ or business teacher so right now my courses fit the field pretty well. **Is this something I should talk to a counselor about?** I'm thinking right now I'd work in the business field for maybe a decade or so and maybe after that look for a teaching job after I've established some financial stability.

Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!

I wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:

As technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. 

First, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.

Why? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying ""production fee"". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.

So I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for ""advertising materials"", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.

So I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.

You think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.

So after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?

So finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?

Wrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.

My blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.

So we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like ""yeah our contract is one page long."" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.

So our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.

I love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.

So on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.

I could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice.

--------------------------------------------------------------

And nobody will believe me.

Most of what we experience as teachers is out of our control. Chances are, we cannot change the administration, policies, or the other endless issues that make our jobs tough.

My second year of teaching, I realized that all I had control over, really, was my own classroom. That does not mean that I do not ever try to change anything else (I take on countless leadership opportunities in my school), but my classroom is my number one priority.

I have worked with and mentored many teachers. No matter how many warnings I give about classroom management, no matter how I model for them, they always have the same issues, and it makes their lives harder. Even on this subreddit, I am met often with defensiveness and hostility when I give advice about classroom management. I know and understand why.

My first year of teaching was terrible - seriously really bad. It was the worst and hardest year of my life. I vowed to never, ever allow my classes to be like that again, and I knew it all came down to my management.

That summer I studied every resource I could about how to manage my classes. My second year was 1,000 times better.

Now, I almost never have discipline problems, and I work with some of the toughest kids. I work in one of the poorest counties in the United States. 

I am 5'2, petite, and I probably look no older than 20. But somehow I can control students who are twice my height and kind of jerks. How?

Again and again, I can see nearly every class problem attributed to poor classroom management. Even teachers I work with who have been teaching twenty years struggle with it. They make the same mistakes over and over, and they make their lives harder. They go home exhausted. They hate their jobs.

Still, no matter how high my test scores are, no matter how great my classes are, there is nothing I can do to get most teachers to believe me. But, if you are one of the teachers reading this, who does believe me, read my advice below.

Just to note, as we approach the end of the year, it will probably be really hard to change much (not that it is hopeless), so focus on what you can change for next year. Also, this post is not just for little kids. All of this stuff can apply to all grade levels, even high school! Here are my tips that have never failed me. 

**Day 1, Week 1** 

Everything, and I mean everything you do, on the first week of school will affect the rest of your year. You must plan this week accordingly. I recommend that you have all your process and procedures built into your week one lessons. I do NOT care what age level the students are. If you notice on this subreddit, 1st graders need this as much as 9th graders.

Figure out how you want your classroom to operate...every detail. I make my students take notes on my classroom procedures and policies on the first day, and throughout the week, I have them practice. The first week is great for correcting students. Did not enter your classroom correctly? Make them enter again. 

This does not mean my first week is spent only on processes and procedures. I integrate them directly into my lessons. Want students to work in groups? Show them how the first day and make them practice! Want students to talk? Have them talk the first day.

**Consistency**

Everything you do from this point on must be in line with what you set up your first week. Many teachers start off strong, but then they become more lenient. Do NOT start being nice about your rules for any reason. I tell my students that I do not care if it is the first day of school or the last. If they break my rules, there will be consequences.

**Positive Classroom Environment**

This starts with day one. I use Positive Behavior Supports (PBS). Look it up. I would say 90% of my interactions with students are positive. I notice what they are doing right. That does not mean I never call students out or deal with issues, but I always do my best to use positive language. This is not easy and I still slip, especially with hard classes. However, my students, no matter who they are, respond well to this. Of course, it has to start from day one. Examples:

*I love how Johnny started working right away.

*Thank you for entering my classroom quietly.

*Wow, this group is working so hard. I really appreciate that.

It comes off as corny, but I do not care. I use it to address both individuals, groups, and a class as a whole. 

Really look at your language. Is it mostly positive or mostly negative? Set a goal for yourself. I try to notice 5 good things each class.

**Mutual Respect**

I have four major rules in my classes, and the processes and procedures are how those rules are carried out. 

Think about the major rules that will promote a positive learning environment. My number one rule is the golden rule, and that seems to encompass nearly everything.

On the first day, I say something like this:

*In life, you are not going to like everybody you work with. You are not going to like every teacher. You do not even have to like me. But, we should always have respect for each other. We are going to have good days and bad days, but it is always about respect.*

This automatically stops the students from acting out simply because they do not like you. Although I wish every student would like me, that just is not going to happen, and I am not going to like every student. We can still have respect for each other though. And chances are, if we really work on that respect, we end up liking each other.

**Relationships with Parents**

Do not treat parents as enemies. I see teachers do this all wrong. People can say I am weak, but I usually bend toward the needs of parents unless their wants are truly unreasonable.

If parents like you, their kids will likely like you. If parents like you, they are more likely to go to you with concerns than to administration. If parents like you, they are more likely to dismiss your mistakes. 

Pick and choose your battles wisely. If a parent emails me and asks for a reasonable extension on an assignment for their student, I say yes. I am not going to waste two days fighting over one assignment.

I know there are unreasonable requests, and you have to decide your threshold. But overall, I really work with parents or at least negotiate with them.

Make sure your first interaction with parents is positive before PTC. Find a way to either call them or meet them beforehand. Be creative. I did a family night this year, and it was early enough in the year that the interactions could be postive. I do tell parents something like this (corny but I do not care):

*I love the relationships I form with students and parents. If I am ever having any issues or concern with your student, you will be the first to know.*

And it is true (consistency). So much can be solved from a simple phone call. After the first few weeks, you know who your trouble-makers are. Call home.

When talking to parents frame it likes this:

*Positive: Always start on a positive note.

*Negative: Address the issue

*Positive: End on a positive note and always thank them for their support.

This work with emails, phone calls, PTC, etc.

Do not make parents your enemy. I am not saying that I have never had bad interactions with parents, but I would say that I have had 99% percent positive interactions due to the mentality that we are on the same team.

**Do Not Become a Dictator**

Rules are important, but I see some teachers go crazy with them. Now you have to do what your administration wants you to do, and there is no choice in the matter. However, nothing is perfect and neither are your students. Pick and choose your battles wisely. 

For example, let's say you have a no food rule, but your student is truly working and they are quickly eating a cookie. How do you address this? I usually go about doing it this way:

""I wanted to remind you that we have a no food rule. However, I can tell you are working and are not making a mess. In the future, though, do not bring food.""

I have seen teachers lose their shit over stuff like this. If it happens again after that point, then I will follow through and ask them to remove the food. The two things that matter are how you frame your language and what battles are worth fighting.

Chances are if you address situations postively and respectively, they will work out.

I see teachers who are feared and yell constantly. That is fine if that is your style, but I do not want to have a heart attack before I am 40. 

Save your mean voice for when it is really needed. I rarely yell, but when I do, the students listen.

**I have tried everything and...**

If you truly have followed what I mentioned above, and you still have issues with a student, then you need to make a plan with administration and parents. This means that you have done every intervention (call home, counseling referral, conference, etc.) and this student has not changed.

This means there is usually more the story. You need to completely understand the rules and procedues in your school and how situations like this are addressed. If I have done everything I can for a student, and it still is not working, then it becomes an administration issue.

I am lucky to work in a school where the admin is pretty good about discipline, but even I think they give too many chances. That is why I set up my classroom so that they are my last resort. I would rather deal with parents than admin, and I like my admin! 

Chances are a lot of you work in schools with crappy admin. That is why it is so important that you set up your classroom so you have to deal with them as little as possible. I really like to keep my interactions with them minimal. Plus, they love that I give them less work.

This year I have only had one student where I referred. I did every intervention I could, and it was just not working. When I finally went to admin, I had all this evidence to show that I did what I could, and now it is in their hands. 

Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I see teachers use the same strategy with a difficult student, even if it is not working. If it is not working, stop doing it!

**Off days**

Even your best students will have bad days. Pick and choose how you handle the sitation. 

Let's say one of your students just broke up with their boyfriend and they are super depressed. Should I scream at them to take notes? Or can I talk to them one on one and give them an alternative?

I usually say something like this:

""Normally you are so on task, but I can tell something is wrong. Today I will let this slide, but could you maybe write a letter about how you are feeling so I understand? If not, I need you to take the notes. Maybe go take a quick break and them come back and do what you need to do.""

Some students write the letter and some take the notes. The point is, I work with them.

Most behavior issues are usually due to something outside your classroom, and a gentle but firm approach works much better than screaming.

**Breaks and Rewards**

Build in breaks and rewards. I know this goes against what you probably hear, but hear me out.

As for breaks, if I see my students really hyper, sometimes I turn off the lights and tell them to ""be bored and clear their mind"" for a minute or two. This really works! I do not allow them to talk during this time, and then I turn the lights back on what it is calmer. 

Also, ensure that there are transitions built into your lessons. Do not ever lecture for more than 20 minutes unless you are the world's best speaker. If you are going to lecture the whole period, build in breaks into the lecture (think pair share, a video, etc.)

A lot of teachers are against rewarding students, but I am not. Some things I do that work:

*Write little notes and give the student the note as I walk by. This helps the ""cool kids"" who do not want to be embarrassed.

*Classroom incentives: You can do nearly anything here. Usually I do something with attitude or behavior, and then we have a classroom movie/party. Ask me more about how I do this because I know admin. are crazy about wasted class time.

*Random treat days: Example: ""You guys have been working so hard all week, so I brought popcorn in for everybody today. Thank you so much.""

Yes it costs me money, but to me it is worth it. Clearly I do not do this all the time.

*Student of the Month/Character Traits: Do not wait for admin or grade level to do all the honoring. I use ""character report cards"" to honor students of the month in my class. I choose a character trait (optimism, zest, etc.) and honor two students per class per month. You can go anywhere you want with this! Give them a cheap certificate and a sucker. They will be happy (any age!)

*Be creative: You do not have to wait for something big to reward a student! Example:

""Andrew, I can tell you have been really improving since our last conversation a week ago. Here is a free homework pass. Thank you!""

**Controlled Chaos**

Sometimes your classroom will get loud. Sometimes it will get off topic. Sometimes kids mess around. Can you bring them back? That is the important question.

Have a quiet signal. I do not care what it is, but keep it consistent and use it all year. I use ""Give Me 5"" and it works, even with my 8th graders, right now during this terrible time of the year.

As long as I can bring my students back, I know I have control.

**Conclusion**

I could keep going and going and going. If you really think about it, this is all about psychology. When you are working with people, even students, use psychology! Everything I posted here can be backed up by actual research, and this is not me just making up stuff.

Still, no matter how many times I work with teachers, they would rather find out the hard way.

As the end of the year closes, what in your class needs to change? Did you have processes and procedures this year? Were you consistent? What worked and what did not? Do you truly have classroom management?

I am willing to help anybody here. I am willing to clarify anything. Ask me absolutely anything!

And remember, be yourself. Take what is good about who you are and bring it into your teaching. I love photography and post photos I took all around. I have a dark sense of humor and love joking with my students. I am a neat freak and short and I make fun of myself. You do not have to be a robot!

It is never going to be perfect. As I wrap up this year, I already know one or two changes I need to make. Still, I always have the foundation of things that have worked over the years. Everything that I have mentioned in this post works.

I recommend that you have all your process and procedures built into your week one lessons. I do NOT care what age level the students are. If you notice on this subreddit, 1st graders need this as much as 9th graders.

Figure out how you want your classroom to operate...every detail. I make my students take notes on my classroom procedures and policies on the first day, and throughout the week, I have them practice. The first week is great for correcting students. Did not enter your classroom correctly? Make them enter again. 

This does not mean my first week is spent only on processes and procedures. I integrate them directly into my lessons. Want students to work in groups? Show them how the first day and make them practice! Want students to talk? Have them talk the first day.

**Consistency**

Everything you do from this point on must be in line with what you set up your first week. Many teachers start off strong, but then they become more lenient. Do NOT start being nice about your rules for any reason. I tell my students that I do not care if it is the first day of school or the last. If they break my rules, there will be consequences.

**Positive Classroom Environment**

This starts with day one. I use Positive Behavior Supports (PBS). Look it up. I would say 90% of my interactions with students are positive. I notice what they are doing right. That does not mean I never call students out or deal with issues, but I always do my best to use positive language. This is not easy and I still slip, especially with hard classes. However, my students, no matter who they are, respond well to this. Of course, it has to start from day one. Examples:

*I love how Johnny started working right away.

*Thank you for entering my classroom quietly.

*Wow, this group is working so hard. I really appreciate that.

It comes off as corny, but I do not care. I use it to address both individuals, groups, and a class as a whole. 

Really look at your language. Is it mostly positive or mostly negative? Set a goal for yourself. I try to notice 5 good things each class.

**Mutual Respect**

I have four major rules in my classes, and the processes and procedures are how those rules are carried out. 

Think about the major rules that will promote a positive learning environment. My number one rule is the golden rule, and that seems to encompass nearly everything.

On the first day, I say something like this:

*In life, you are not going to like everybody you work with. You are not going to like every teacher. You do not even have to like me. But, we should always have respect for each other. We are going to have good days and bad days, but it is always about respect.*

This automatically stops the students from acting out simply because they do not like you. Although I wish every student would like me, that just is not going to happen, and I am not going to like every student. We can still have respect for each other though. And chances are, if we really work on that respect, we end up liking each other.

**Relationships with Parents**

Do not treat parents as enemies. I see teachers do this all wrong. People can say I am weak, but I usually bend toward the needs of parents unless their wants are truly unreasonable.

If parents like you, their kids will likely like you. If parents like you, they are more likely to go to you with concerns than to administration. If parents like you, they are more likely to dismiss your mistakes. 

Pick and choose your battles wisely. If a parent emails me and asks for a reasonable extension on an assignment for their student, I say yes. I am not going to waste two days fighting over one assignment.

I know there are unreasonable requests, and you have to decide your threshold. But overall, I really work with parents or at least negotiate with them.

Make sure your first interaction with parents is positive before PTC. Find a way to either call them or meet them beforehand. Be creative. I did a family night this year, and it was early enough in the year that the interactions could be postive. I do tell parents something like this (corny but I do not care):

*I love the relationships I form with students and parents. If I am ever having any issues or concern with your student, you will be the first to know.*

And it is true (consistency). So much can be solved from a simple phone call. After the first few weeks, you know who your trouble-makers are. Call home.

When talking to parents frame it likes this:

*Positive: Always start on a positive note.

*Negative: Address the issue

*Positive: End on a positive note and always thank them for their support.

This work with emails, phone calls, PTC, etc.

Do not make parents your enemy. I am not saying that I have never had bad interactions with parents, but I would say that I have had 99% percent positive interactions due to the mentality that we are on the same team.

**Do Not Become a Dictator**

Rules are important, but I see some teachers go crazy with them. Now you have to do what your administration wants you to do, and there is no choice in the matter. However, nothing is perfect and neither are your students. Pick and choose your battles wisely. 

For example, let's say you have a no food rule, but your student is truly working and they are quickly eating a cookie. How do you address this? I usually go about doing it this way:

""I wanted to remind you that we have a no food rule. However, I can tell you are working and are not making a mess. In the future, though, do not bring food.""

I have seen teachers lose their shit over stuff like this. If it happens again after that point, then I will follow through and ask them to remove the food. The two things that matter are how you frame your language and what battles are worth fighting.

Chances are if you address situations postively and respectively, they will work out.

I see teachers who are feared and yell constantly. That is fine if that is your style, but I do not want to have a heart attack before I am 40. 

Save your mean voice for when it is really needed. I rarely yell, but when I do, the students listen.

**I have tried everything and...**

If you truly have followed what I mentioned above, and you still have issues with a student, then you need to make a plan with administration and parents. This means that you have done every intervention (call home, counseling referral, conference, etc.) and this student has not changed.

This means there is usually more the story. You need to completely understand the rules and procedues in your school and how situations like this are addressed. If I have done everything I can for a student, and it still is not working, then it becomes an administration issue.

I am lucky to work in a school where the admin is pretty good about discipline, but even I think they give too many chances. That is why I set up my classroom so that they are my last resort. I would rather deal with parents than admin, and I like my admin! 

Chances are a lot of you work in schools with crappy admin. That is why it is so important that you set up your classroom so you have to deal with them as little as possible. I really like to keep my interactions with them minimal. Plus, they love that I give them less work.

This year I have only had one student where I referred. I did every intervention I could, and it was just not working. When I finally went to admin, I had all this evidence to show that I did what I could, and now it is in their hands. 

Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I see teachers use the same strategy with a difficult student, even if it is not working. If it is not working, stop doing it!

**Off days**

Even your best students will have bad days. Pick and choose how you handle the sitation. 

Let's say one of your students just broke up with their boyfriend and they are super depressed. Should I scream at them to take notes? Or can I talk to them one on one and give them an alternative?

I usually say something like this:

""Normally you are so on task, but I can tell something is wrong. Today I will let this slide, but could you maybe write a letter about how you are feeling so I understand? If not, I need you to take the notes. Maybe go take a quick break and them come back and do what you need to do.""

Some students write the letter and some take the notes. The point is, I work with them.

Most behavior issues are usually due to something outside your classroom, and a gentle but firm approach works much better than screaming.

**Breaks and Rewards**

Build in breaks and rewards. I know this goes against what you probably hear, but hear me out.

As for breaks, if I see my students really hyper, sometimes I turn off the lights and tell them to ""be bored and clear their mind"" for a minute or two. This really works! I do not allow them to talk during this time, and then I turn the lights back on what it is calmer. 

Also, ensure that there are transitions built into your lessons. Do not ever lecture for more than 20 minutes unless you are the world's best speaker. If you are going to lecture the whole period, build in breaks into the lecture (think pair share, a video, etc.)

A lot of teachers are against rewarding students, but I am not. Some things I do that work:

*Write little notes and give the student the note as I walk by. This helps the ""cool kids"" who do not want to be embarrassed.

*Classroom incentives: You can do nearly anything here. Usually I do something with attitude or behavior, and then we have a classroom movie/party. Ask me more about how I do this because I know admin. are crazy about wasted class time.

*Random treat days: Example: ""You guys have been working so hard all week, so I brought popcorn in for everybody today. Thank you so much.""

Yes it costs me money, but to me it is worth it. Clearly I do not do this all the time.

*Student of the Month/Character Traits: Do not wait for admin or grade level to do all the honoring. I use ""character report cards"" to honor students of the month in my class. I choose a character trait (optimism, zest, etc.) and honor two students per class per month. You can go anywhere you want with this! Give them a cheap certificate and a sucker. They will be happy (any age!)

*Be creative: You do not have to wait for something big to reward a student! Example:

""Andrew, I can tell you have been really improving since our last conversation a week ago. Here is a free homework pass. Thank you!""

**Controlled Chaos**

Sometimes your classroom will get loud. Sometimes it will get off topic. Sometimes kids mess around. Can you bring them back? That is the important question.

Have a quiet signal. I do not care what it is, but keep it consistent and use it all year. I use ""Give Me 5"" and it works, even with my 8th graders, right now during this terrible time of the year.

As long as I can bring my students back, I know I have control.

**Conclusion**

I could keep going and going and going. If you really think about it, this is all about psychology. When you are working with people, even students, use psychology! Everything I posted here can be backed up by actual research, and this is not me just making up stuff.

Still, no matter how many times I work with teachers, they would rather find out the hard way.

As the end of the year closes, what in your class needs to change? Did you have processes and procedures this year? Were you consistent? What worked and what did not? Do you truly have classroom management?

I am willing to help anybody here. I am willing to clarify anything. Ask me absolutely anything!

And remember, be yourself. Take what is good about who you are and bring it into your teaching. I love photography and post photos I took all around. I have a dark sense of humor and love joking with my students. I am a neat freak and short and I make fun of myself. You do not have to be a robot!

It is never going to be perfect. As I wrap up this year, I already know one or two changes I need to make. Still, I always have the foundation of things that have worked over the years. Everything that I have mentioned in this post works.

I hope this post can help at least one person.",8,compound,0.9997,2017

This is my 4th year. Im urban, low income, predominantly African american and Hispanic building. From year one to now I've taught in the same building, two different schools (one was closed, the next one hired me), and three different admins. I've fostered two of my former students. I've had zero provided curriculum. My team members have quit and walked out. I've been called a stanky ass bitch to my face by a student while she was dancing on a table. I was yelled at by a co teacher that I am the most self centered and conceited person she's had to work with, told that I believe my classroom revolves around myself. I've often had no ESL staff in the building with students that speak zero English. I've also often had no SPED teacher or resources because we can't keep positions filled. I'm earning less this year than the year before.  

And today a student commented that he likes my class because he noticed how I scaffold my lessons. (He didnt say scaffold of course.) I was stunned. 

And now that I'm reflecting from his comment.... I'm a kick ass teacher this year. I have 5 classes of 32+ kids ENGAGED and DISCUSSING in literature circles with a novel about an 11 year old girl in Vietnam. We start every class with silent, independent reading...and you can hear a pin drop during this time. They're READING, not just pretending. I have to threaten the kids with lunch detention if they try to hug me (they keep getting me sick). We had a meaningful discussion about mental health, homelessness, and PTSD.... And no one was yelling over each other. 

I just...I wanted to share a positive. I needed a positive. I've been so busy seeing what i don't have that I didnt notice the change in my room over the past years.

I'm a 9th grade history teacher in rural bumfuck nowhere, USA. As the title implies, I have severe depression (and also anxiety! Double whammy!). I also just resigned from my 5th year of teaching, 1 month into the year. 

I was smart about how I started teaching. I didn't take on any non-teaching responsibilities, such as coaching or club sponsoring, until after my 4th year. I gave myself 4 years to acclimate, to make sure I was continually growing in my material, and was becoming a stronger and stronger teacher every day. I attended dozens of conferences. I annoyed the hell out of experienced teachers, a few of whom winners of Teacher of the Year, with questions and lesson-plan advice. I made sure that I paced myself and kept to a considerate schedule, so that I wouldn't find myself exhausted every day. 

So before you even think it, no, it's not burnout. I love this job. I love it. Seriously. I live for waking up at 5am, getting ready, commuting 30 minutes to school, and making last-minute lesson plan tweaks to ensure everything is in place for my kids. Every moment I spend in the classroom with my scholars is a happy one. I have a smile on my face constantly. My kids, every year, show at least a 60% improvement on the state tests. They consistently perform strongly in the upper-level humanities courses, because they learned multi-source research, critical reading, and comprehensive writing skills in my class. I'm good at my job.

I am broken. My body is broken. My soul is broken. 

I am not fit to be an educator, a mentor, a loco parentis, when I can't remember deadlines, even though I've written them across all iOS applications and physically in 2 planners. When I am slowly losing grip on my content because my brain is chaos incarnate with pain and confusion. When I have come down with the flu, a stomach virus, and pinkeye... all after getting the flu vaccine. When I am becoming irrational, hateful, and yet strangely numb. Every day is an out-of-body experience, during which I watch myself scream at family and loved ones or ignore them completely, while bringing a sunnily dysfunctional smile into my classroom. 

I am not me. 

Yes, this is dramatic. I know.

I am now headed to rehab, where I will receive counseling every day, and begin an intensive round of medication to make me feel human again. I will start to re-study my content, find my love for it, and find my love for myself, in the process. 

I'm writing this because teachers, we have the world's most amazing yet shittiest job. We're barely paid to cultivate the future of our world. We aren't just lesson-planning, grading, and teaching - on top of it all, we have administrative duties, extracurricular duties, and familial duties. Our job is a 24/7 endeavor. And sometimes, we get tired. We burn out. It happens. And that's okay.

But I want you to know that sometimes, what is happening to me will happen to a few of you, too. And you're going to realize that you are fragmenting into a million pieces of glass and you can't hold it together anymore, not even for your students.

I hated myself for even thinking of resigning, especially in the middle of the year, because I was abandoning my school and my students. Our job is for them. 

But as most of you know already, you need to love yourself, too. Maybe you won't need to resign and escape, like I do. Some of you will think me weak. A quitter. A little bitch who is too selfish to ever be a good teacher. That's okay.

But after rehab, I'm going to come back better, even if not fully healed, stronger, and prepared. My students will have a teacher who is ferociously ready to educate them and love them. 

Please...please take care of yourself. Seek help as soon as possible. Take sick leave if you need it. Find peace. It's not easy, but from one Eeyore to many others...you can do it.

I'm a 9th grade history teacher in rural bumfuck nowhere, USA. As the title implies, I have severe depression (and also anxiety! Double whammy!). I also just resigned from my 5th year of teaching, 1 month into the year. 

I was smart about how I started teaching. I didn't take on any non-teaching responsibilities, such as coaching or club sponsoring, until after my 4th year. I gave myself 4 years to acclimate, to make sure I was continually growing in my material, and was becoming a stronger and stronger teacher every day. I attended dozens of conferences. I annoyed the hell out of experienced teachers, a few of whom winners of Teacher of the Year, with questions and lesson-plan advice. I made sure that I paced myself and kept to a considerate schedule, so that I wouldn't find myself exhausted every day. 

So before you even think it, no, it's not burnout. I love this job. I love it. Seriously. I live for waking up at 5am, getting ready, commuting 30 minutes to school, and making last-minute lesson plan tweaks to ensure everything is in place for my kids. Every moment I spend in the classroom with my scholars is a happy one. I have a smile on my face constantly. My kids, every year, show at least a 60% improvement on the state tests. They consistently perform strongly in the upper-level humanities courses, because they learned multi-source research, critical reading, and comprehensive writing skills in my class. I'm good at my job.

I feel like it is rarely said but I really mean it. A couple of days ago, a teacher from our school named Mrs. Eddy passed away due to cancer. We had all known about it. Hell, when I had her for Honors English 11, she would sometimes have to miss class for chemotherapy sessions. At the beginning of the school year, she took an extended leave which turned out to be indefinite. 

The reason I say this is because Mrs. Eddy was one of the few teachers I actually gave a shit about. She was the first person to EVER care about my writing and inspired me to read and write like no other teacher did. I got back into poetry and screenplay writing because of her. 

I am not going to say that she changed my life or that she was that one teacher that inspired me to be great. That shit is for the movies. However, she was a great teacher, a wonderful person, and a kind soul.

It saddens me to think about the fact that I never got to tell her that. 

So for all the teachers out there who wake up every morning, and inspire, thank you. I know it's not easy. Teaching isn't an easy job. I couldn't do it, especially if I had cancer. 

Mrs. Eddy, my thoughts are with you tonight.

And to all other teachers, thank you for everything you do.

So, you've decided you're out.  You're going to duck out, and check facebook.

But you've already sat too close to your administrator (your 5th in 4 years!) to just walk out.  You've GOT to have a plan.

**Step one:** Set up an excuse.  I am a huge fan of the ""not feeling well"" with maybe some loose bowels.  First, cover your stomach with just one forearm.  Make an ""uhhh"" sound.  Then reach into your pocket or purse.  Grab something that could be about the size of a small pill bottle.  Anything.  Lipstick.  Ipod Nano.  Balled up piece of paper.  Shake a couple ""A-D pills"" into your hand. They're tiny.  If you're really dedicated, get a small piece of green paper, and tear off two little pieces, then ball them up.  Take these.

Continue to sit there for a few minutes.  Then grab your stuff, and take off.  ACTUALLY go to the bathroom.  You're going to need to have some witnesses.  Make some grimacing faces as you go.  You may need to actually add some grunting sounds if someone else is in there.  Remain for 3-4 minutes, then go buy yourself a sprite from the staff soda machine.

Now, head back to the training room.  But now, sit or stand as close to the door as possible, and drink your sprite.  It should be obvious you're drinking a sprite to feel better.

Give it about 10 more minutes, and then when another co-worker is getting out, go out IN FRONT of them. A rookie mistake is to follow them out.  But then it's obvious you're sneaking out.  But because you're close to the door, it may even appear that you're just opening the door for them.  Or even better, no one may see you.

So, now you've escaped.  You've set up the ""they're sick but sticking it out"" excuse, and you're free for another hour or so.

But where to go?


**The Bathroom**

DO NOT go here.  First off, your admin might actually go there.  You could try to hide in a stall, but really, who wants to spend their free hour in a bathroom stall?


**A Computer Lab**

This is pretty high risk, but is usually quiet, without a ton of people there.  If you do, make sure to open a tab to WebMD, and put it to ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"".  At this point, you could be setting up a year-long excuse, so good call.  I still don't encourage you to do this, though.


**The Library**

Lots of places to hide in most libraries.  Between shelves, in study cubicles, or inside of the now-empty shelves where books used to go when your district had money before spending millions of consultants.


**The Dark Room (Secondary only)**

Many of you don't know about the truly DARK places of the school.  There are many of them.  Since most of our schools haven't been updated since the 1970s, there is almost certainly a dark room in your school.  You may not even know what it looks like, but it's in your school's art room, and there is a wall or door with a spinning black tube.  You enter in one door, and spin the room to another door.  There are chemicals that haven't been used since the mid-90s, plus a ton of old digital cameras and wires.  The bad news is that your students are also aware of this room, and there is the potential for some dried body fluids in here that you don't want anywhere near you.  VERY high risk, but virtually no risk of being caught.

There are other similar ""dark rooms"" in your school.  Audio visual rooms, ticket rooms, sports storage rooms, tech rooms, band practice rooms.


**Your Classroom**

DO NOT go here.  If someone decides to actually look for you, they might find you here.  That's not what you want!  Avoid your own room at all costs.


**Chemical Storage Room**

This is the perfect hiding place.  Your administrator doesn't really know this room exists.  Even if they do, they never go in there.  Students aren't allowed in there.  You might have to talk to your chemistry teacher, who is likely hiding in there as well, but trust me, they're no narc.


**Going Back:**

With about 10 minutes left, you're going to have to sneak back in.  Now you're going to want to go in second, and immediately peel off to the side of the room.  Remember your imaginary pills?  Pop two more of those.

Now that you're back, sit quietly.  But during the questions period, ask a yes or no question that is related to your field, and can be asked in a few seconds.  My personal go to is ""Would you see this applying to _____?"" where they can say yes, and move on.  And that way everyone sees that you were there, and their brain will assume you've been there the whole time.

On Saturday, I had a meeting with my boss and I had my lawyer and union leader by my side. This was about my relationship with a former student who graduated 12 years ago, my boss tried his hardest to make it out like I had feelings for him when he was my student and then he tried his best to find reasons to fire me. 

He said that he does not want the school to be known as the place where a teacher and a student fell in love, despite the fact that we didn't when he was a student, it was 12 years later. Long story short, he lost his case and now, his place at the school is in jeopardy and I'm going to receive a good amount of money from this case. 

I can now live my life without worrying about my job, my boyfriend and I are having a great time now and we are thinking of taking a nice long vacation soon. 

I've been teaching since I was 24 and this had to be one of the most ridiculous things that has ever happened to me.

Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who replied to that post, you guys helped.  

Unfortunately, the issue didn’t stop in my classroom. As suspected, the three girls I mentioned started talking about the incident in their next class, prompting their teacher to ask what happened. Without going into too much detail, as you can imagine, I came across as the bad person in their story. Just before the end of my last class of the day, I received an email from the principal asking if I can come to his office after school. At the time, I didn’t know what he wanted.  

I got to the foyer outside his office and noticed those three girls in there, snickering to each other. That was when I knew what was going on. Walked into my principal’s office and asked me what happened in class earlier. Told him pretty much everything that was in my previous post. My side of the story had no comparison with the girl’s story. According to them, I had been stroking that student’s hair, touching his hands, then touched below the belt whilst he was by the board. I should note here, that my principal and admin are not very supportive, expect us to be perfect and seem to pander to students more than staff. This is why I panicked earlier.   

At this point, I had been in there at least 10 minutes discussing this with him and didn’t seem to be getting far. Fortunately, another student in my class told the student who I touched about the girls making a false story. The student who I touched walked into the principal’s office (didn’t knock) and said something along the lines of, “Whatever those three idiots have said isn’t true. At no point did she touch my hair or hands, she accidentally knocked into me when turning around. This is ridiculous.” Just like that, the principal's whole tone of voice and demeanour changed and he finally seemed to accept my side of the story.   

He called the girls in, gave them a stern talking to, which caused them to cry. Shortly after, he told them to apologise to me. They are going to have 3-day suspension.   

The student who walked into the office is also going to be punished for not knocking and waiting to be called in, and for calling the girls idiots. He also missed his bus so he had to walk home. 

So, that was a nasty few hours today and I need to find a new school. Again, thank you to everyone, who commented earlier.

Our school year is finally over. Every teacher knows the exhilarating feeling of watching your class walk out of your room for the very last time. Usually, you are hit with the Two R's: Relief and Regret. Sometimes they're equal, but usually you feel one of the R's more than the other. For this cohort, the R I felt most was definitely Relief, as I honestly feel this was the toughest year of my teaching career. 

I am a second grade teacher. My main audience is 7-8 year olds, and I can safely say that for the most part, you don't have to deal with much in the way of extremes at this age, at least, not in the way you'd have to deal in extremes with older kids. 

At the beginning of the school year when I was given my class list, I was literally coached on one particular student who would be in my class, who had garnished himself a pretty stout reputation with his Kindergarten and 1st Grade Teachers already. He was one of THOSE kids; the kind who has severe ADD/ADHD/Some sort of mental disorder, yet his parents absolutely refused to get him any sort of medical treatment. For the sake of this story, let's just call this kid Larry to maintain anonymity. 

Larry's Mom and Dad are divorced, but still maintain enough contact to be civil at birthday parties. They are also rumored to be 2nd cousins or something, which may be an explanation for Larry's issues. Dad is a hardworking construction buff and Mom is a stay-at-home medical marijuana patient. All throughout K and 1st, Larry's trip through school was, for a lack of better words, an absolute nightmare. Neither of his teachers could control him. He had set a record for most pink slips ever administered to a Kindergartener, and the most trips to the Principal's office simply due to his behavior.

So I'm being briefed about all of this at the beginning of the year, and I'm being told I'm next on Larry's list. My principal is giving me all this information and doing his best to support me, but I guess I don't look to terribly thrilled to hear the news. Not exactly the most optimistic way to start off the year.

Anyways, Meet The Teacher night rolls around, and in bounds Larry, who immediately begins pinging around all over the room. Dad comes over and shakes my hand, introduces himself, and introduces Larry. He's a real stand-up guy and you can definitely tell he is trying his damnest to make sure his son is successful and the best he can be. He mentions that this is the first year Larry will be on medication. He caved after the end of last year when Larry was suspended for defecating on a desk and the principal insisted directly to Larry's dad that medication be researched. 

And for the most part, Larry doesn't seem any worse than my average 2nd grader coming into their new classroom for the first time. Sure, he's a bit energetic, but nothing I can't seem to handle.

We get into the school year and I can definitely tell when Larry does and does not take his medicine in the morning. On the days he is medicated, Larry is attentive, longs to do good by me, constantly asks if he is being good, and is very helpful and active. On the days he DOESN'T take the meds, he is loud, boisterous, unattentive, out of his chair every 30 seconds, and a serious distraction to the classroom. He is also emotional and sensitive nearly ALL the time, meds or not, and it shows when you show that he's done something to disappoint you. Behavior aside, he is about par in terms of math, and just a bit on the bogey side in terms of reading and writing.

Before I know it, we're at the halfway mark. Last day of school before Christmas Break. Larry's running late. About 30 minutes after the bell rings, my door opens and in walks Larry with a large wrapped gift. And his father is right behind him. Turns out, Larry had been paying really close attention when I once mentioned who my favorite Pokemon was, and him and his father made me a gift basket containing Pokemon stuff focused around my favorite (Mimikyu). I was touched. This was the most personal gift any of my students had ever given me. I gave Larry a big hug and shook Dad's hand, and Dad said to me with a smile ""I'm very blessed to have you as my son's teacher. This is the first year he has actually wanted to come to school and he adores you. You have shown him that school is a fun place, not one where he is in trouble all the time!"" I replied with ""He has earned that right! He has improved so much since last year! The credit isn't all mine. It's his as well!""

About the time the fourth quarter rolls around, I decided to make a big decision and named Larry as our class's Student of the Month. That entails getting a custom lunch from a local burger joint, getting to eat with the Principal, and then enjoying a recess in the office with all the other Student of the Month students from other classes, playing games and winning prizes. For the reason, I simply wrote ""Larry is an excellent student who always strives to do his best, even when he is at his worst."" 

That evening, I received a phone call. It was Larry's Dad. He asked if we could meet tomorrow morning before school started. I agreed and asked if everything was okay, and all he said was ""I need to talk to you face to face."" Then he hung up very suddenly, which I thought was very strange. At first, I was startled. I messaged my principal and told him what happened. He said Larry's dad never had any ill beef with any of the previous teachers, but said he could be nearby if I wanted him to be, just in case. I told him I didn't think that'd be necessary, but I did want to inform him.

The next morning, after a restless night, I met with Larry's Dad in my room. He came in and I offered him a chair, but before I could get the chance to grab one, I found myself in one of the biggest hugs I've ever received. And this man was crying. 

""You....you don't know how much your kind gesture means to me."" He said in between sobs. ""I never thought my son would be considered for Student of the Month. The amount of pride and joy I felt last night as he told me that you chose him is the highest I have ever felt. I just wanted to thank you."" I was touched. I teared up. He cried. I cried. We hugged. I told him that Larry was a sweet, excellent kid, and buried deep under his problems was a hard-working student just bursting to get out. 

After Dad left, I talked with my principal and told him what happened. He just smiled and returned to his office. And later, once the year was completely over and I was meeting with my principal for our final checkout, he mentions the amazing transformation I was able to help with Larry. He described it as a ""Night and day difference. A Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde change."" He also said he was very proud of me for finding a way to get through to him. And for the record, Larry never went to the Principal's office even once this year. Was I really to credit for this? Was it the medicine? I'm not one to relish in praise, so I'm keen to say the meds played a huge part in the change, but there is that presence that says to me ""Would it have been this significant of a change if I wasn't the teacher?""

And as you all know, the school year is now over. Larry was all energy and excitement and left the room in a hurry when the bell rang, as he typically does. But I know that I will not forget him and he will not forget me. Dad called and thanked me again for everything and for helping his son see the reasons for going to school. I made an impact on his life and his Dad's. And in the end, after a hellaciously long year, after a ton of stress and a ton of head-banging days, I know I will miss him.

Was it tough at times? Sure. It was difficult. Getting angry on the days he couldn't stay in his chair because he didn't take his medicine, or getting upset because he just wouldn't shut up during our lessons on counting money, or even when I did have to yell at him and separate him from his group...no matter the number of times we butted heads, he always left my room with a smile and gave me a high five.

I don't really know why I wanted to share this. I guess I just wanted to say that sometimes, our favorite students (even though we shouldn't pick favorites, but we all know we do) will be the ones you simply cannot stand.

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate.

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own.

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own. This is why we waste time in my classroom.",66,compound,0.9977,2017

I've only lurked on this sub for a few months, but I've noticed a huge influx of first time teachers (which I assume is common around this time of year) so, first of all, congratulations! Teaching is incredible. It's fun, it (can be) rewarding, but there are some scary parts to it. So much so that [8% of teachers quit per year](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/24/495186021/what-are-the-main-reasons-teachers-call-it-quits), which is alarmingly high, but even worse is that [4 in 10 new teachers quit within the first year](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit-within-a-year). Yikes.

Now there's many reasons for that, but a lot of it (my opinion) comes from ignorance to the profession. So to help combat that, I'm going to laundry list a bunch of random tips/suggestions/things in no particular order that helped me my first year or so, and if anyone else feels so inclined to add to this, please do so.

DISCLAIMER: my suggestions apply to mainly high and possibly middle. Some of my suggestions might be the polar opposite for elementary; I can't speak on grades 1-5. 

* Teaching is a balance of combining your personality, strengths, and style with what has already been proven to work. Don't try and reinvent the wheel; you're not the first person to ever step in a classroom, but at the same time don't just run to your Classroom Management textbook from your Sophmore year of college every time little Timmy rolls his eyes. 
* Your school should have a mentoring program of sorts, if not, find someone in your department that you can basically follow around like a hawk. Find someone that's approachable and good with the kids - you'll be able to tell from the first time you talk to them. Trust me. Try to not find someone that is jaded, which depending on the school/district, that'll be very hard to do. Mimic that person to a tee. You'll find that some of the stuff he/she does is great for you while others you can do without. No two classes are the same. You could be teaching American History and the teacher across the hall which is doing the exact same unit as you with the exact same assessments, but it'll be ran differently. Find what works for you. 
* Don't do the same things two years in a row. I don't mean curriculum (though you'll definitely be tweaking that for the first few years), but rather the way you approach it. Find what work and what doesn't. You may find that you don't like some of the things that the teacher with 30 years experience does. That's okay.  
* Be willing to drop whatever isn't working. It sucks when you spend all weekend working on a lesson plan only to realize that it didn't at all come out the way you intended. Always have a fallback.
* Learn to read the students' body language. I don't care if you have the most well-behaved, disciplined, AP students. If you see a sea of glossed over eyes, you've lost them. Stop and move on to something else (especially applicable to those of you who are teaching in 90 minute periods).
* Whatever grade you teach, talk to them two grades higher. I teach freshmen and juniors English honors and I have the same spiel every year. For my juniors it's that they're two years away from sitting in a college classroom, so they need to act like adults. For my freshman I semi-unintentionally scare them with my ""this is an honors level class, and I expect honors level behavior and effort. If you cannot do that, then go to guidance now and switch to a regular level class."" That causes them to perk up. My logic is that high schoolers are either of age to drive or about to be, and if the US says that they are old enough to drive a giant piece of metal on a highway going 70 mph, then they are mature enough to do what is asked of them.
* Don't take their opinions of you personally. They're going to be varied. I had a kid tell me that I'm his favorite teacher he's ever had while the student right next to him absolutely hated me. It'll happen. No sweat. In this regard, treat teaching like a normal job. If you focus on trying to get them all to like you, then you're going to have a bad time.
* Treat them like adults until they act like a child.
* DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CREATE A RULE THAT YOU DON'T INTEND ON ENFORCING! I made this mistake my first year. Kids will test you. If you stupidly put a dumb rule in your syllabus, you're stuck with it for the whole year. 
* Speaking of syllabus, if your school allows you to tweak it, I like to ask for parent's e-mail, cell-phone, and also which method of contact that they prefer (I've had it bite me before in parent meetings when they said I called but should have e-mailed or vice versa).
* Hope you like tape. This job has more red tape and bureaucracy than I ever would have imagined - which brings me to my next point...
* CYA. Document every single little thing that you can imagine, especially behavior issues. You don't want to be sitting in a parent conference with the principal in March and not have anything to back up what you've been saying (as a side note, this is another reason why I prefer e-mail over phonecalls with parents). Literally document everything. ""On 10/3 at 11:38 AM, Timmy took out his cell phone. Received verbal warning. 10/4 11:00 AM Timmy took out phone. Issued detention. Called home on 10/4 at 3:00 P. No answer. Left voicemail detailing incident. Sent email on 10/4 at 3:15 P. E-mail attached."" Is it a pain? Yes. But it is so necessary, and nothing shuts up the ""my child is an angel and would never do that"" parent quicker than that.
* Be available to kids. You'll get a few that latch on to you. I had a few that came to me for tutoring during lunch and it turned into a mini counseling sessions with things they were struggling with school wise and friends.
* But be careful. Remember that you are required by law to report any signs of abuse or any indication of self-harm.
* Be respectful of other teachers. For some reason students think that it's okay to berate other teachers to the ""cool"" teachers. Don't allow them to do that. Cut it off immediately. You may share their opinion, but remember the classroom isn't a place for gossip. You are their instructor. They'll respect that.
* Enjoy what you teach. I mean, this should be a very ""duh"" point, but you will be amazed at how many experienced teachers hate their subject. Yes, there's going to be parts of it you don't like, and that's okay, but whatever you don't like, multiply that by 50. That's how your kids feel.
* But the flip side of that is things you are enthusiastic about goes over so much better than things you're indifferent. I'm one of the few out there that still loves teaching ""The Scarlet Letter"" and the vast majority of my kids like it too because of how we approach the text.
* Remember where you are. You may love what you're teaching, but the kid in front of you might hate every single thing about your subject. Think back to your least liked subject in school and how you felt about it. Now realize that in every period there's a few of those kids sitting there.
* 504's are not an excuse to be lazy (NOTE: I have no idea what 504/IEP's are called in other states. They might be the same thing. I can only speak for Florida). Some students will have accommodations whether they're ELL or something else. You have zero authority to override an IEP/504 (note that you will have a meeting with guidance and you will be able to give your input about accommodations per student, but in the classroom, you have to go by whatever they need). The brutal reality is that some students manipulate the system. In Florida it's incredibly easy to get accommodations. The most common one is extended time. That's not just on quizzes/tests. That's for homework/papers/projects/anything. You could inevitably have a student who waits until the bitter end to turn in everything. A 504 IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BE LAZY! But it's tricky. Sometimes you cannot enforce a strict deadline. This is where communication with the parent and guidance is paramount as well as documentation.
* Be very aware of what else is going on in school and be sympathetic to it. For example, I know a lot of my students are in AP classes, so I try to make the workload light come around April-May. I also know that a lot of them take SATs around that time, so I come up with SAT prep exercises that also align with the standards I'm teaching (something that is very easy to do with English in particular). Homecoming is next week and the kids are excited? Don't assign a weekend project. Things like that. 
* Male teachers: Be very aware that you are a male. Don't find yourself alone in a classroom with any student male or female. I'll have one or two come talk to me privately for whatever reason and I do the same thing. I float by door in eyesight of anyone that could be in the hallway. Don't ever allow the door to be closed. Even if they're coming to you for something personal, explain to them that you have to keep the door open.  

Okay, this turned out to be significantly longer than I had imagined. I'll update if I think of more. But if you hung in this long, that already shows you care. It's fun. It's hard. Probably harder than anything you've done before, but man, seeing the lightbulb click in the faces is awesome. It's worth it if you can stick with it.

No. There are plenty of 8th graders that can get their shit together with or without adult intervention. This child has earned a 40% and I cannot in good faith bump it to a 60%.

Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!

I wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:

As technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. 

First, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.

Why? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying ""production fee"". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.

So I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for ""advertising materials"", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.

So I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.

You think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.

So after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?

So finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?

Wrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.

My blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.

So we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like ""yeah our contract is one page long."" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.

So our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.

I love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.

So on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.

I could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice.

Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!

I wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:

As technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. 

First, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.

Why? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying ""production fee"". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.

So I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for ""advertising materials"", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.

So I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.

You think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.

So after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?

So finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?

Wrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.

My blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.

So we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like ""yeah our contract is one page long."" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.

So our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.

I love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.

So on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.

I could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice.

--------------------------------------------------------------

And nobody will believe me.

Most of what we experience as teachers is out of our control. Chances are, we cannot change the administration, policies, or the other endless issues that make our jobs tough.

My second year of teaching, I realized that all I had control over, really, was my own classroom. That does not mean that I do not ever try to change anything else (I take on countless leadership opportunities in my school), but my classroom is my number one priority.

I have worked with and mentored many teachers. No matter how many warnings I give about classroom management, no matter how I model for them, they always have the same issues, and it makes their lives harder. Even on this subreddit, I am met often with defensiveness and hostility when I give advice about classroom management. I know and understand why.

My first year of teaching was terrible - seriously really bad. It was the worst and hardest year of my life. I vowed to never, ever allow my classes to be like that again, and I knew it all came down to my management.

That summer I studied every resource I could about how to manage my classes. My second year was 1,000 times better.

Now, I almost never have discipline problems, and I work with some of the toughest kids. I work in one of the poorest counties in the United States. 

I am 5'2, petite, and I probably look no older than 20. But somehow I can control students who are twice my height and kind of jerks. How?

Again and again, I can see nearly every class problem attributed to poor classroom management. Even teachers I work with who have been teaching twenty years struggle with it. They make the same mistakes over and over, and they make their lives harder. They go home exhausted. They hate their jobs.

Still, no matter how high my test scores are, no matter how great my classes are, there is nothing I can do to get most teachers to believe me. But, if you are one of the teachers reading this, who does believe me, read my advice below.

Just to note, as we approach the end of the year, it will probably be really hard to change much (not that it is hopeless), so focus on what you can change for next year. Also, this post is not just for little kids. All of this stuff can apply to all grade levels, even high school! Here are my tips that have never failed me. 

**Day 1, Week 1** 

Everything, and I mean everything you do, on the first week of school will affect the rest of your year. You must plan this week accordingly. I recommend that you have all your process and procedures built into your week one lessons. I do NOT care what age level the students are. If you notice on this subreddit, 1st graders need this as much as 9th graders.

Figure out how you want your classroom to operate...every detail. I make my students take notes on my classroom procedures and policies on the first day, and throughout the week, I have them practice. The first week is great for correcting students. Did not enter your classroom correctly? Make them enter again. 

This does not mean my first week is spent only on processes and procedures. I integrate them directly into my lessons. Want students to work in groups? Show them how the first day and make them practice! Want students to talk? Have them talk the first day.

**Consistency**

Everything you do from this point on must be in line with what you set up your first week. Many teachers start off strong, but then they become more lenient. Do NOT start being nice about your rules for any reason. I tell my students that I do not care if it is the first day of school or the last. If they break my rules, there will be consequences.

**Positive Classroom Environment**

This starts with day one. I use Positive Behavior Supports (PBS). Look it up. I would say 90% of my interactions with students are positive. I notice what they are doing right. That does not mean I never call students out or deal with issues, but I always do my best to use positive language. This is not easy and I still slip, especially with hard classes. However, my students, no matter who they are, respond well to this. Of course, it has to start from day one. Examples:

*I love how Johnny started working right away.

*Thank you for entering my classroom quietly.

*Wow, this group is working so hard. I really appreciate that.

It comes off as corny, but I do not care. I use it to address both individuals, groups, and a class as a whole. 

Really look at your language. Is it mostly positive or mostly negative? Set a goal for yourself. I try to notice 5 good things each class.

**Mutual Respect**

I have four major rules in my classes, and the processes and procedures are how those rules are carried out. 

Think about the major rules that will promote a positive learning environment. My number one rule is the golden rule, and that seems to encompass nearly everything.

On the first day, I say something like this:

*In life, you are not going to like everybody you work with. You are not going to like every teacher. You do not even have to like me. But, we should always have respect for each other. We are going to have good days and bad days, but it is always about respect.*

This automatically stops the students from acting out simply because they do not like you. Although I wish every student would like me, that just is not going to happen, and I am not going to like every student. We can still have respect for each other though. And chances are, if we really work on that respect, we end up liking each other.

**Relationships with Parents**

Do not treat parents as enemies. I see teachers do this all wrong. People can say I am weak, but I usually bend toward the needs of parents unless their wants are truly unreasonable.

If parents like you, their kids will likely like you. If parents like you, they are more likely to go to you with concerns than to administration. If parents like you, they are more likely to dismiss your mistakes. 

Pick and choose your battles wisely. If a parent emails me and asks for a reasonable extension on an assignment for their student, I say yes. I am not going to waste two days fighting over one assignment.

I know there are unreasonable requests, and you have to decide your threshold. But overall, I really work with parents or at least negotiate with them.

Make sure your first interaction with parents is positive before PTC. Find a way to either call them or meet them beforehand. Be creative. I did a family night this year, and it was early enough in the year that the interactions could be postive. I do tell parents something like this (corny but I do not care):

*I love the relationships I form with students and parents. If I am ever having any issues or concern with your student, you will be the first to know.*

And it is true (consistency). So much can be solved from a simple phone call. After the first few weeks, you know who your trouble-makers are. Call home.

When talking to parents frame it likes this:

*Positive: Always start on a positive note.

*Negative: Address the issue

*Positive: End on a positive note and always thank them for their support.

This work with emails, phone calls, PTC, etc.

Do not make parents your enemy. I am not saying that I have never had bad interactions with parents, but I would say that I have had 99% percent positive interactions due to the mentality that we are on the same team.

**Do Not Become a Dictator**

Rules are important, but I see some teachers go crazy with them. Now you have to do what your administration wants you to do, and there is no choice in the matter. However, nothing is perfect and neither are your students. Pick and choose your battles wisely. 

For example, let's say you have a no food rule, but your student is truly working and they are quickly eating a cookie. How do you address this? I usually go about doing it this way:

""I wanted to remind you that we have a no food rule. However, I can tell you are working and are not making a mess. In the future, though, do not bring food.""

I have seen teachers lose their shit over stuff like this. If it happens again after that point, then I will follow through and ask them to remove the food. The two things that matter are how you frame your language and what battles are worth fighting.

Chances are if you address situations postively and respectively, they will work out.

I see teachers who are feared and yell constantly. That is fine if that is your style, but I do not want to have a heart attack before I am 40. 

Save your mean voice for when it is really needed. I rarely yell, but when I do, the students listen.

**I have tried everything and...**

If you truly have followed what I mentioned above, and you still have issues with a student, then you need to make a plan with administration and parents. This means that you have done every intervention (call home, counseling referral, conference, etc.) and this student has not changed.

This means there is usually more the story. You need to completely understand the rules and procedues in your school and how situations like this are addressed. If I have done everything I can for a student, and it still is not working, then it becomes an administration issue.

I am lucky to work in a school where the admin is pretty good about discipline, but even I think they give too many chances. That is why I set up my classroom so that they are my last resort. I would rather deal with parents than admin, and I like my admin! 

Chances are a lot of you work in schools with crappy admin. That is why it is so important that you set up your classroom so you have to deal with them as little as possible. I really like to keep my interactions with them minimal. Plus, they love that I give them less work.

This year I have only had one student where I referred. I did every intervention I could, and it was just not working. When I finally went to admin, I had all this evidence to show that I did what I could, and now it is in their hands. 

Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I see teachers use the same strategy with a difficult student, even if it is not working. If it is not working, stop doing it!

**Off days**

Even your best students will have bad days. Pick and choose how you handle the sitation. 

Let's say one of your students just broke up with their boyfriend and they are super depressed. Should I scream at them to take notes? Or can I talk to them one on one and give them an alternative?

I usually say something like this:

""Normally you are so on task, but I can tell something is wrong. Today I will let this slide, but could you maybe write a letter about how you are feeling so I understand? If not, I need you to take the notes. Maybe go take a quick break and them come back and do what you need to do.""

Some students write the letter and some take the notes. The point is, I work with them.

Most behavior issues are usually due to something outside your classroom, and a gentle but firm approach works much better than screaming.

**Breaks and Rewards**

Build in breaks and rewards. I know this goes against what you probably hear, but hear me out.

As for breaks, if I see my students really hyper, sometimes I turn off the lights and tell them to ""be bored and clear their mind"" for a minute or two. This really works! I do not allow them to talk during this time, and then I turn the lights back on what it is calmer. 

Also, ensure that there are transitions built into your lessons. Do not ever lecture for more than 20 minutes unless you are the world's best speaker. If you are going to lecture the whole period, build in breaks into the lecture (think pair share, a video, etc.)

A lot of teachers are against rewarding students, but I am not. Some things I do that work:

*Write little notes and give the student the note as I walk by. This helps the ""cool kids"" who do not want to be embarrassed.

*Classroom incentives: You can do nearly anything here. Usually I do something with attitude or behavior, and then we have a classroom movie/party. Ask me more about how I do this because I know admin. are crazy about wasted class time.

*Random treat days: Example: ""You guys have been working so hard all week, so I brought popcorn in for everybody today. Thank you so much.""

Yes it costs me money, but to me it is worth it. Clearly I do not do this all the time.

*Student of the Month/Character Traits: Do not wait for admin or grade level to do all the honoring. I use ""character report cards"" to honor students of the month in my class. I choose a character trait (optimism, zest, etc.) and honor two students per class per month. You can go anywhere you want with this! Give them a cheap certificate and a sucker. They will be happy (any age!)

*Be creative: You do not have to wait for something big to reward a student! Example:

""Andrew, I can tell you have been really improving since our last conversation a week ago. Here is a free homework pass. Thank you!""

**Controlled Chaos**

Sometimes your classroom will get loud. Sometimes it will get off topic. Sometimes kids mess around. Can you bring them back? That is the important question.

Have a quiet signal. I do not care what it is, but keep it consistent and use it all year. I use ""Give Me 5"" and it works, even with my 8th graders, right now during this terrible time of the year.

As long as I can bring my students back, I know I have control.

**Conclusion**

I could keep going and going and going. If you really think about it, this is all about psychology. When you are working with people, even students, use psychology! Everything I posted here can be backed up by actual research, and this is not me just making up stuff.

Still, no matter how many times I work with teachers, they would rather find out the hard way.

As the end of the year closes, what in your class needs to change? Did you have processes and procedures this year? Were you consistent? What worked and what did not? Do you truly have classroom management?

I am willing to help anybody here. I am willing to clarify anything. Ask me absolutely anything!

And remember, be yourself. Take what is good about who you are and bring it into your teaching. I love photography and post photos I took all around. I have a dark sense of humor and love joking with my students. I am a neat freak and short and I make fun of myself. You do not have to be a robot!

It is never going to be perfect. As I wrap up this year, I already know one or two changes I need to make. Still, I always have the foundation of things that have worked over the years. Everything that I have mentioned in this post works.

I hope this post can help at least one person.",False,False,Teachers,t5_2qqcs,,self,Classroom Management is Everything,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/609vsw/classroom_management_is_everything/,1489945577.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-03-19 12:46:17+00:00,"Classroom Management is EverythingEdit: Whoever gave me gold, I am very thankful!! I wish I knew who it was!

--------------------------------------------------------------

And nobody will believe me.

Most of what we experience as teachers is out of our control. Chances are, we cannot change the administration, policies, or the other endless issues that make our jobs tough.

My second year of teaching, I realized that all I had control over, really, was my own classroom. That does not mean that I do not ever try to change anything else (I take on countless leadership opportunities in my school), but my classroom is my number one priority.

I have worked with and mentored many teachers. No matter how many warnings I give about classroom management, no matter how I model for them, they always have the same issues, and it makes their lives harder. Even on this subreddit, I am met often with defensiveness and hostility when I give advice about classroom management. I know and understand why.

My first year of teaching was terrible - seriously really bad. It was the worst and hardest year of my life. I vowed to never, ever allow my classes to be like that again, and I knew it all came down to my management.

That summer I studied every resource I could about how to manage my classes. My second year was 1,000 times better.

Now, I almost never have discipline problems, and I work with some of the toughest kids. I work in one of the poorest counties in the United States. 

I am 5'2, petite, and I probably look no older than 20. But somehow I can control students who are twice my height and kind of jerks. How?

Again and again, I can see nearly every class problem attributed to poor classroom management. Even teachers I work with who have been teaching twenty years struggle with it. They make the same mistakes over and over, and they make their lives harder. They go home exhausted. They hate their jobs.

Still, no matter how high my test scores are, no matter how great my classes are, there is nothing I can do to get most teachers to believe me. But, if you are one of the teachers reading this, who does believe me, read my advice below.

Just to note, as we approach the end of the year, it will probably be really hard to change much (not that it is hopeless), so focus on what you can change for next year. Also, this post is not just for little kids. All of this stuff can apply to all grade levels, even high school! Here are my tips that have never failed me. 

**Day 1, Week 1** 

Everything, and I mean everything you do, on the first week of school will affect the rest of your year. You must plan this week accordingly. I recommend that you have all your process and procedures built into your week one lessons. I do NOT care what age level the students are. If you notice on this subreddit, 1st graders need this as much as 9th graders.

Figure out how you want your classroom to operate...every detail. I make my students take notes on my classroom procedures and policies on the first day, and throughout the week, I have them practice. The first week is great for correcting students. Did not enter your classroom correctly? Make them enter again. 

This does not mean my first week is spent only on processes and procedures. I integrate them directly into my lessons. Want students to work in groups? Show them how the first day and make them practice! Want students to talk? Have them talk the first day.

**Consistency**

Everything you do from this point on must be in line with what you set up your first week. Many teachers start off strong, but then they become more lenient. Do NOT start being nice about your rules for any reason. I tell my students that I do not care if it is the first day of school or the last. If they break my rules, there will be consequences.

**Positive Classroom Environment**

This starts with day one. I use Positive Behavior Supports (PBS). Look it up. I would say 90% of my interactions with students are positive. I notice what they are doing right. That does not mean I never call students out or deal with issues, but I always do my best to use positive language. This is not easy and I still slip, especially with hard classes. However, my students, no matter who they are, respond well to this. Of course, it has to start from day one. Examples:

*I love how Johnny started working right away.

*Thank you for entering my classroom quietly.

*Wow, this group is working so hard. I really appreciate that.

It comes off as corny, but I do not care. I use it to address both individuals, groups, and a class as a whole. 

Really look at your language. Is it mostly positive or mostly negative? Set a goal for yourself. I try to notice 5 good things each class.

**Mutual Respect**

I have four major rules in my classes, and the processes and procedures are how those rules are carried out. 

Think about the major rules that will promote a positive learning environment. My number one rule is the golden rule, and that seems to encompass nearly everything.

On the first day, I say something like this:

*In life, you are not going to like everybody you work with. You are not going to like every teacher. You do not even have to like me. But, we should always have respect for each other. We are going to have good days and bad days, but it is always about respect.*

This automatically stops the students from acting out simply because they do not like you. Although I wish every student would like me, that just is not going to happen, and I am not going to like every student. We can still have respect for each other though. And chances are, if we really work on that respect, we end up liking each other.

I feel like it is rarely said but I really mean it. A couple of days ago, a teacher from our school named Mrs. Eddy passed away due to cancer. We had all known about it. Hell, when I had her for Honors English 11, she would sometimes have to miss class for chemotherapy sessions. At the beginning of the school year, she took an extended leave which turned out to be indefinite. 

The reason I say this is because Mrs. Eddy was one of the few teachers I actually gave a shit about. She was the first person to EVER care about my writing and inspired me to read and write like no other teacher did. I got back into poetry and screenplay writing because of her. 

I am not going to say that she changed my life or that she was that one teacher that inspired me to be great. That shit is for the movies. However, she was a great teacher, a wonderful person, and a kind soul.

It saddens me to think about the fact that I never got to tell her that. 

So for all the teachers out there who wake up every morning, and inspire, thank you. I know it's not easy. Teaching isn't an easy job. I couldn't do it, especially if I had cancer. 

Mrs. Eddy, my thoughts are with you tonight.

And to all other teachers, thank you for everything you do.

So, you've decided you're out.  You're going to duck out, and check facebook.

But you've already sat too close to your administrator (your 5th in 4 years!) to just walk out.  You've GOT to have a plan.

**Step one:** Set up an excuse.  I am a huge fan of the ""not feeling well"" with maybe some loose bowels.  First, cover your stomach with just one forearm.  Make an ""uhhh"" sound.  Then reach into your pocket or purse.  Grab something that could be about the size of a small pill bottle.  Anything.  Lipstick.  Ipod Nano.  Balled up piece of paper.  Shake a couple ""A-D pills"" into your hand. They're tiny.  If you're really dedicated, get a small piece of green paper, and tear off two little pieces, then ball them up.  Take these.

Continue to sit there for a few minutes.  Then grab your stuff, and take off.  ACTUALLY go to the bathroom.  You're going to need to have some witnesses.  Make some grimacing faces as you go.  You may need to actually add some grunting sounds if someone else is in there.  Remain for 3-4 minutes, then go buy yourself a sprite from the staff soda machine.

Now, head back to the training room.  But now, sit or stand as close to the door as possible, and drink your sprite.  It should be obvious you're drinking a sprite to feel better.

Give it about 10 more minutes, and then when another co-worker is getting out, go out IN FRONT of them. A rookie mistake is to follow them out.  But then it's obvious you're sneaking out.  But because you're close to the door, it may even appear that you're just opening the door for them.  Or even better, no one may see you.

So, now you've escaped.  You've set up the ""they're sick but sticking it out"" excuse, and you're free for another hour or so.

But where to go?


**The Bathroom**

DO NOT go here.  First off, your admin might actually go there.  You could try to hide in a stall, but really, who wants to spend their free hour in a bathroom stall?


**A Computer Lab**

This is pretty high risk, but is usually quiet, without a ton of people there.  If you do, make sure to open a tab to WebMD, and put it to ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"".  At this point, you could be setting up a year-long excuse, so good call.  I still don't encourage you to do this, though.


**The Library**

Lots of places to hide in most libraries.  Between shelves, in study cubicles, or inside of the now-empty shelves where books used to go when your district had money before spending millions of consultants.


**The Dark Room (Secondary only)**

Many of you don't know about the truly DARK places of the school.  There are many of them.  Since most of our schools haven't been updated since the 1970s, there is almost certainly a dark room in your school.  You may not even know what it looks like, but it's in your school's art room, and there is a wall or door with a spinning black tube.  You enter in one door, and spin the room to another door.  There are chemicals that haven't been used since the mid-90s, plus a ton of old digital cameras and wires.  The bad news is that your students are also aware of this room, and there is the potential for some dried body fluids in here that you don't want anywhere near you.  VERY high risk, but virtually no risk of being caught.

There are other similar ""dark rooms"" in your school.  Audio visual rooms, ticket rooms, sports storage rooms, tech rooms, band practice rooms.


**Your Classroom**

DO NOT go here.  If someone decides to actually look for you, they might find you here.  That's not what you want!  Avoid your own room at all costs.


**Chemical Storage Room**

This is the perfect hiding place.  Your administrator doesn't really know this room exists.  Even if they do, they never go in there.  Students aren't allowed in there.  You might have to talk to your chemistry teacher, who is likely hiding in there as well, but trust me, they're no narc.


**Going Back:**

With about 10 minutes left, you're going to have to sneak back in.  Now you're going to want to go in second, and immediately peel off to the side of the room.  Remember your imaginary pills?  Pop two more of those.

Now that you're back, sit quietly.  But during the questions period, ask a yes or no question that is related to your field, and can be asked in a few seconds.  My personal go to is ""Would you see this applying to _____?"" where they can say yes, and move on.  And that way everyone sees that you were there, and their brain will assume you've been there the whole time.

On Saturday, I had a meeting with my boss and I had my lawyer and union leader by my side. This was about my relationship with a former student who graduated 12 years ago, my boss tried his hardest to make it out like I had feelings for him when he was my student and then he tried his best to find reasons to fire me. 

He said that he does not want the school to be known as the place where a teacher and a student fell in love, despite the fact that we didn't when he was a student, it was 12 years later. Long story short, he lost his case and now, his place at the school is in jeopardy and I'm going to receive a good amount of money from this case. 

I can now live my life without worrying about my job, my boyfriend and I are having a great time now and we are thinking of taking a nice long vacation soon. 

I've been teaching since I was 24 and this had to be one of the most ridiculous things that has ever happened to me. I don't know what it's like for the rest of you, but this was a really weird case.

Our school year is finally over. Every teacher knows the exhilarating feeling of watching your class walk out of your room for the very last time. Usually, you are hit with the Two R's: Relief and Regret. Sometimes they're equal, but usually you feel one of the R's more than the other. For this cohort, the R I felt most was definitely Relief, as I honestly feel this was the toughest year of my teaching career. 

I am a second grade teacher. My main audience is 7-8 year olds, and I can safely say that for the most part, you don't have to deal with much in the way of extremes at this age, at least, not in the way you'd have to deal in extremes with older kids. 

At the beginning of the school year when I was given my class list, I was literally coached on one particular student who would be in my class, who had garnished himself a pretty stout reputation with his Kindergarten and 1st Grade Teachers already. He was one of THOSE kids; the kind who has severe ADD/ADHD/Some sort of mental disorder, yet his parents absolutely refused to get him any sort of medical treatment. For the sake of this story, let's just call this kid Larry to maintain anonymity. 

Larry's Mom and Dad are divorced, but still maintain enough contact to be civil at birthday parties. They are also rumored to be 2nd cousins or something, which may be an explanation for Larry's issues. Dad is a hardworking construction buff and Mom is a stay-at-home medical marijuana patient. All throughout K and 1st, Larry's trip through school was, for a lack of better words, an absolute nightmare. Neither of his teachers could control him. He had set a record for most pink slips ever administered to a Kindergartener, and the most trips to the Principal's office simply due to his behavior.

So I'm being briefed about all of this at the beginning of the year, and I'm being told I'm next on Larry's list. My principal is giving me all this information and doing his best to support me, but I guess I don't look to terribly thrilled to hear the news. Not exactly the most optimistic way to start off the year.

Anyways, Meet The Teacher night rolls around, and in bounds Larry, who immediately begins pinging around all over the room. Dad comes over and shakes my hand, introduces himself, and introduces Larry. He's a real stand-up guy and you can definitely tell he is trying his damnest to make sure his son is successful and the best he can be. He mentions that this is the first year Larry will be on medication. He caved after the end of last year when Larry was suspended for defecating on a desk and the principal insisted directly to Larry's dad that medication be researched. 

And for the most part, Larry doesn't seem any worse than my average 2nd grader coming into their new classroom for the first time. Sure, he's a bit energetic, but nothing I can't seem to handle.

We get into the school year and I can definitely tell when Larry does and does not take his medicine in the morning. On the days he is medicated, Larry is attentive, longs to do good by me, constantly asks if he is being good, and is very helpful and active. On the days he DOESN'T take the meds, he is loud, boisterous, unattentive, out of his chair every 30 seconds, and a serious distraction to the classroom. He is also emotional and sensitive nearly ALL the time, meds or not, and it shows when you show that he's done something to disappoint you. Behavior aside, he is about par in terms of math, and just a bit on the bogey side in terms of reading and writing.

Before I know it, we're at the halfway mark. Last day of school before Christmas Break. Larry's running late. About 30 minutes after the bell rings, my door opens and in walks Larry with a large wrapped gift. And his father is right behind him. Turns out, Larry had been paying really close attention when I once mentioned who my favorite Pokemon was, and him and his father made me a gift basket containing Pokemon stuff focused around my favorite (Mimikyu). I was touched. This was the most personal gift any of my students had ever given me. I gave Larry a big hug and shook Dad's hand, and Dad said to me with a smile ""I'm very blessed to have you as my son's teacher. This is the first year he has actually wanted to come to school and he adores you. You have shown him that school is a fun place, not one where he is in trouble all the time!"" I replied with ""He has earned that right! He has improved so much since last year! The credit isn't all mine. It's his as well!""

About the time the fourth quarter rolls around, I decided to make a big decision and named Larry as our class's Student of the Month. That entails getting a custom lunch from a local burger joint, getting to eat with the Principal, and then enjoying a recess in the office with all the other Student of the Month students from other classes, playing games and winning prizes. For the reason, I simply wrote ""Larry is an excellent student who always strives to do his best, even when he is at his worst."" 

That evening, I received a phone call. It was Larry's Dad. He asked if we could meet tomorrow morning before school started. I agreed and asked if everything was okay, and all he said was ""I need to talk to you face to face."" Then he hung up very suddenly, which I thought was very strange. At first, I was startled. I messaged my principal and told him what happened. He said Larry's dad never had any ill beef with any of the previous teachers, but said he could be nearby if I wanted him to be, just in case. I told him I didn't think that'd be necessary, but I did want to inform him.

The next morning, after a restless night, I met with Larry's Dad in my room. He came in and I offered him a chair, but before I could get the chance to grab one, I found myself in one of the biggest hugs I've ever received. And this man was crying. 

""You....you don't know how much your kind gesture means to me."" He said in between sobs. ""I never thought my son would be considered for Student of the Month. The amount of pride and joy I felt last night as he told me that you chose him is the highest I have ever felt. I just wanted to thank you."" I was touched. I teared up. He cried. I cried. We hugged. I told him that Larry was a sweet, excellent kid, and buried deep under his problems was a hard-working student just bursting to get out. 

After Dad left, I talked with my principal and told him what happened. He just smiled and returned to his office. And later, once the year was completely over and I was meeting with my principal for our final checkout, he mentions the amazing transformation I was able to help with Larry. He described it as a ""Night and day difference. A Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde change."" He also said he was very proud of me for finding a way to get through to him. And for the record, Larry never went to the Principal's office even once this year. Was I really to credit for this? Was it the medicine? I'm not one to relish in praise, so I'm keen to say the meds played a huge part in the change, but there is that presence that says to me ""Would it have been this significant of a change if I wasn't the teacher?""

And as you all know, the school year is now over. Larry was all energy and excitement and left the room in a hurry when the bell rang, as he typically does. But I know that I will not forget him and he will not forget me. Dad called and thanked me again for everything and for helping his son see the reasons for going to school. I made an impact on his life and his Dad's. And in the end, after a hellaciously long year, after a ton of stress and a ton of head-banging days, I know I will miss him.

Was it tough at times? Sure. It was difficult. Getting angry on the days he couldn't stay in his chair because he didn't take his medicine, or getting upset because he just wouldn't shut up during our lessons on counting money, or even when I did have to yell at him and separate him from his group...no matter the number of times we butted heads, he always left my room with a smile and gave me a high five.

I guess I just wanted to say that sometimes, our favorite students (even though we shouldn't pick favorites, but we all know we do) will be the ones you simply cannot stand.

At the beginning of each block I like to talk to my students. I don’t give them any directions; I don’t tell them anything important. We just talk.

I siege them with questions. I hurl shot after shot into the room and latch onto what they throw back. Early in the year I’m satisfied with a couple of timid answers. After a brief statement about a birthday party or a complaint about work, I downshift and the class lurches into English mode. 

Eventually they talk back. 

**Talking Back**

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate. They no longer wait for my questions, but instead go on the offensive. Sometimes I’m flattered (when students want to know how I met my smoking hot wife). Other times I’m agitated (when students resolutely defended the stance that advertising had no effect on their lives.) Mostly, though, I enjoy a casual camaraderie with my class as I share interesting things I either know about (like the inevitable [house centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata)), or things I’ve been thinking about (anything from the value of dogs to [why female students have better handwriting than male](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2xwhhj/why_do_girls_tend_to_have_better_handwriting_than/)). They piggyback off my stories and share experiences of their own; they piggyback off my ideas and share ideas of their own.

As the year goes on, I inevitably see students grin widely. They ask questions about things that they suspect I might want to speak at-length about. *He’s doing it again*, they think as they ask about my projects, my travel, my outfit. *We waste so much time in this class.*

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

If tasked to defend this getting-to-know-you time, say, in front of an administrator, I might speak at some length about the conversational skills it builds. Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers. I could argue that I am modelling good conversation skills and hitting speaking and listening standards in the process.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own.

I've only lurked on this sub for a few months, but I've noticed a huge influx of first time teachers (which I assume is common around this time of year) so, first of all, congratulations! Teaching is incredible. It's fun, it (can be) rewarding, but there are some scary parts to it. So much so that [8% of teachers quit per year](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/24/495186021/what-are-the-main-reasons-teachers-call-it-quits), which is alarmingly high, but even worse is that [4 in 10 new teachers quit within the first year](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit-within-a-year). Yikes.

Now there's many reasons for that, but a lot of it (my opinion) comes from ignorance to the profession. So to help combat that, I'm going to laundry list a bunch of random tips/suggestions/things in no particular order that helped me my first year or so, and if anyone else feels so inclined to add to this, please do so.

DISCLAIMER: my suggestions apply to mainly high and possibly middle. Some of my suggestions might be the polar opposite for elementary; I can't speak on grades 1-5. 

* Teaching is a balance of combining your personality, strengths, and style with what has already been proven to work. Don't try and reinvent the wheel; you're not the first person to ever step in a classroom, but at the same time don't just run to your Classroom Management textbook from your Sophmore year of college every time little Timmy rolls his eyes. 
* Your school should have a mentoring program of sorts, if not, find someone in your department that you can basically follow around like a hawk. Find someone that's approachable and good with the kids - you'll be able to tell from the first time you talk to them. Trust me. Try to not find someone that is jaded, which depending on the school/district, that'll be very hard to do. Mimic that person to a tee. You'll find that some of the stuff he/she does is great for you while others you can do without. No two classes are the same. You could be teaching American History and the teacher across the hall which is doing the exact same unit as you with the exact same assessments, but it'll be ran differently. Find what works for you. 
* Don't do the same things two years in a row. I don't mean curriculum (though you'll definitely be tweaking that for the first few years), but rather the way you approach it. Find what work and what doesn't. You may find that you don't like some of the things that the teacher with 30 years experience does. That's okay.  
* Be willing to drop whatever isn't working. It sucks when you spend all weekend working on a lesson plan only to realize that it didn't at all come out the way you intended. Always have a fallback.
* Learn to read the students' body language. I don't care if you have the most well-behaved, disciplined, AP students. If you see a sea of glossed over eyes, you've lost them. Stop and move on to something else (especially applicable to those of you who are teaching in 90 minute periods).
* Whatever grade you teach, talk to them two grades higher. I teach freshmen and juniors English honors and I have the same spiel every year. For my juniors it's that they're two years away from sitting in a college classroom, so they need to act like adults. For my freshman I semi-unintentionally scare them with my ""this is an honors level class, and I expect honors level behavior and effort. If you cannot do that, then go to guidance now and switch to a regular level class."" That causes them to perk up. My logic is that high schoolers are either of age to drive or about to be, and if the US says that they are old enough to drive a giant piece of metal on a highway going 70 mph, then they are mature enough to do what is asked of them.
* Don't take their opinions of you personally. They're going to be varied. I had a kid tell me that I'm his favorite teacher he's ever had while the student right next to him absolutely hated me. It'll happen. No sweat. In this regard, treat teaching like a normal job. If you focus on trying to get them all to like you, then you're going to have a bad time.
* Treat them like adults until they act like a child.
* DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CREATE A RULE THAT YOU DON'T INTEND ON ENFORCING! I made this mistake my first year. Kids will test you. If you stupidly put a dumb rule in your syllabus, you're stuck with it for the whole year. 
* Speaking of syllabus, if your school allows you to tweak it, I like to ask for parent's e-mail, cell-phone, and also which method of contact that they prefer (I've had it bite me before in parent meetings when they said I called but should have e-mailed or vice versa).
* Hope you like tape. This job has more red tape and bureaucracy than I ever would have imagined - which brings me to my next point...
* CYA. Document every single little thing that you can imagine, especially behavior issues. You don't want to be sitting in a parent conference with the principal in March and not have anything to back up what you've been saying (as a side note, this is another reason why I prefer e-mail over phonecalls with parents). Literally document everything. ""On 10/3 at 11:38 AM, Timmy took out his cell phone. Received verbal warning. 10/4 11:00 AM Timmy took out phone. Issued detention. Called home on 10/4 at 3:00 P. No answer. Left voicemail detailing incident. Sent email on 10/4 at 3:15 P. E-mail attached."" Is it a pain? Yes. But it is so necessary, and nothing shuts up the ""my child is an angel and would never do that"" parent quicker than that.
* Be available to kids. You'll get a few that latch on to you. I had a few that came to me for tutoring during lunch and it turned into a mini counseling sessions with things they were struggling with school wise and friends.
* But be careful. Remember that you are required by law to report any signs of abuse or any indication of self-harm.
* Be respectful of other teachers. For some reason students think that it's okay to berate other teachers to the ""cool"" teachers. Don't allow them to do that. Cut it off immediately. You may share their opinion, but remember the classroom isn't a place for gossip. You are their instructor. They'll respect that.
* Enjoy what you teach. I mean, this should be a very ""duh"" point, but you will be amazed at how many experienced teachers hate their subject. Yes, there's going to be parts of it you don't like, and that's okay, but whatever you don't like, multiply that by 50. That's how your kids feel.
* But the flip side of that is things you are enthusiastic about goes over so much better than things you're indifferent. I'm one of the few out there that still loves teaching ""The Scarlet Letter"" and the vast majority of my kids like it too because of how we approach the text.
* Remember where you are. You may love what you're teaching, but the kid in front of you might hate every single thing about your subject. Think back to your least liked subject in school and how you felt about it. Now realize that in every period there's a few of those kids sitting there.
* 504's are not an excuse to be lazy (NOTE: I have no idea what 504/IEP's are called in other states. They might be the same thing. I can only speak for Florida). Some students will have accommodations whether they're ELL or something else. You have zero authority to override an IEP/504 (note that you will have a meeting with guidance and you will be able to give your input about accommodations per student, but in the classroom, you have to go by whatever they need). The brutal reality is that some students manipulate the system. In Florida it's incredibly easy to get accommodations. The most common one is extended time. That's not just on quizzes/tests. That's for homework/papers/projects/anything. You could inevitably have a student who waits until the bitter end to turn in everything. A 504 IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BE LAZY! But it's tricky. Sometimes you cannot enforce a strict deadline. This is where communication with the parent and guidance is paramount as well as documentation.
* Be very aware of what else is going on in school and be sympathetic to it. For example, I know a lot of my students are in AP classes, so I try to make the workload light come around April-May. I also know that a lot of them take SATs around that time, so I come up with SAT prep exercises that also align with the standards I'm teaching (something that is very easy to do with English in particular). Homecoming is next week and the kids are excited? Don't assign a weekend project. Things like that. 
* Male teachers: Be very aware that you are a male. Don't find yourself alone in a classroom with any student male or female. I'll have one or two come talk to me privately for whatever reason and I do the same thing. I float by door in eyesight of anyone that could be in the hallway. Don't ever allow the door to be closed. Even if they're coming to you for something personal, explain to them that you have to keep the door open.

I've only lurked on this sub for a few months, but I've noticed a huge influx of first time teachers (which I assume is common around this time of year) so, first of all, congratulations! Teaching is incredible. It's fun, it (can be) rewarding, but there are some scary parts to it. So much so that [8% of teachers quit per year](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/24/495186021/what-are-the-main-reasons-teachers-call-it-quits), which is alarmingly high, but even worse is that [4 in 10 new teachers quit within the first year](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit-within-a-year). Yikes.

Now there's many reasons for that, but a lot of it (my opinion) comes from ignorance to the profession. So to help combat that, I'm going to laundry list a bunch of random tips/suggestions/things in no particular order that helped me my first year or so, and if anyone else feels so inclined to add to this, please do so.

DISCLAIMER: my suggestions apply to mainly high and possibly middle. Some of my suggestions might be the polar opposite for elementary; I can't speak on grades 1-5. 

* Teaching is a balance of combining your personality, strengths, and style with what has already been proven to work. Don't try and reinvent the wheel; you're not the first person to ever step in a classroom, but at the same time don't just run to your Classroom Management textbook from your Sophmore year of college every time little Timmy rolls his eyes. 
* Your school should have a mentoring program of sorts, if not, find someone in your department that you can basically follow around like a hawk. Find someone that's approachable and good with the kids - you'll be able to tell from the first time you talk to them. Trust me. Try to not find someone that is jaded, which depending on the school/district, that'll be very hard to do. Mimic that person to a tee. You'll find that some of the stuff he/she does is great for you while others you can do without. No two classes are the same. You could be teaching American History and the teacher across the hall which is doing the exact same unit as you with the exact same assessments, but it'll be ran differently. Find what works for you. 
* Don't do the same things two years in a row. I don't mean curriculum (though you'll definitely be tweaking that for the first few years), but rather the way you approach it. Find what work and what doesn't. You may find that you don't like some of the things that the teacher with 30 years experience does. That's okay.  
* Be willing to drop whatever isn't working. It sucks when you spend all weekend working on a lesson plan only to realize that it didn't at all come out the way you intended. Always have a fallback.
* Learn to read the students' body language. I don't care if you have the most well-behaved, disciplined, AP students. If you see a sea of glossed over eyes, you've lost them. Stop and move on to something else (especially applicable to those of you who are teaching in 90 minute periods).
* Whatever grade you teach, talk to them two grades higher. I teach freshmen and juniors English honors and I have the same spiel every year. For my juniors it's that they're two years away from sitting in a college classroom, so they need to act like adults. For my freshman I semi-unintentionally scare them with my ""this is an honors level class, and I expect honors level behavior and effort. If you cannot do that, then go to guidance now and switch to a regular level class."" That causes them to perk up. My logic is that high schoolers are either of age to drive or about to be, and if the US says that they are old enough to drive a giant piece of metal on a highway going 70 mph, then they are mature enough to do what is asked of them.
* Don't take their opinions of you personally. They're going to be varied. I had a kid tell me that I'm his favorite teacher he's ever had while the student right next to him absolutely hated me. It'll happen. No sweat. In this regard, treat teaching like a normal job. If you focus on trying to get them all to like you, then you're going to have a bad time.
* Treat them like adults until they act like a child.
* DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CREATE A RULE THAT YOU DON'T INTEND ON ENFORCING! I made this mistake my first year. Kids will test you. If you stupidly put a dumb rule in your syllabus, you're stuck with it for the whole year. 
* Speaking of syllabus, if your school allows you to tweak it, I like to ask for parent's e-mail, cell-phone, and also which method of contact that they prefer (I've had it bite me before in parent meetings when they said I called but should have e-mailed or vice versa).
* Hope you like tape. This job has more red tape and bureaucracy than I ever would have imagined - which brings me to my next point...
* CYA. Document every single little thing that you can imagine, especially behavior issues. You don't want to be sitting in a parent conference with the principal in March and not have anything to back up what you've been saying (as a side note, this is another reason why I prefer e-mail over phonecalls with parents). Literally document everything. ""On 10/3 at 11:38 AM, Timmy took out his cell phone. Received verbal warning. 10/4 11:00 AM Timmy took out phone. Issued detention. Called home on 10/4 at 3:00 P. No answer. Left voicemail detailing incident. Sent email on 10/4 at 3:15 P. E-mail attached."" Is it a pain? Yes. But it is so necessary, and nothing shuts up the ""my child is an angel and would never do that"" parent quicker than that.
* Be available to kids. You'll get a few that latch on to you. I had a few that came to me for tutoring during lunch and it turned into a mini counseling sessions with things they were struggling with school wise and friends.
* But be careful. Remember that you are required by law to report any signs of abuse or any indication of self-harm.
* Be respectful of other teachers. For some reason students think that it's okay to berate other teachers to the ""cool"" teachers. Don't allow them to do that. Cut it off immediately. You may share their opinion, but remember the classroom isn't a place for gossip. You are their instructor. They'll respect that.
* Enjoy what you teach. I mean, this should be a very ""duh"" point, but you will be amazed at how many experienced teachers hate their subject. Yes, there's going to be parts of it you don't like, and that's okay, but whatever you don't like, multiply that by 50. That's how your kids feel.
* But the flip side of that is things you are enthusiastic about goes over so much better than things you're indifferent. I'm one of the few out there that still loves teaching ""The Scarlet Letter"" and the vast majority of my kids like it too because of how we approach the text.
* Remember where you are. You may love what you're teaching, but the kid in front of you might hate every single thing about your subject. Think back to your least liked subject in school and how you felt about it. Now realize that in every period there's a few of those kids sitting there.
* 504's are not an excuse to be lazy (NOTE: I have no idea what 504/IEP's are called in other states. They might be the same thing. I can only speak for Florida). Some students will have accommodations whether they're ELL or something else. You have zero authority to override an IEP/504 (note that you will have a meeting with guidance and you will be able to give your input about accommodations per student, but in the classroom, you have to go by whatever they need). The brutal reality is that some students manipulate the system. In Florida it's incredibly easy to get accommodations. The most common one is extended time. That's not just on quizzes/tests. That's for homework/papers/projects/anything. You could inevitably have a student who waits until the bitter end to turn in everything. A 504 IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BE LAZY! But it's tricky. Sometimes you cannot enforce a strict deadline. This is where communication with the parent and guidance is paramount as well as documentation.
* Be very aware of what else is going on in school and be sympathetic to it. For example, I know a lot of my students are in AP classes, so I try to make the workload light come around April-May. I also know that a lot of them take SATs around that time, so I come up with SAT prep exercises that also align with the standards I'm teaching (something that is very easy to do with English in particular). Homecoming is next week and the kids are excited? Don't assign a weekend project. Things like that. 
* Male teachers: Be very aware that you are a male. Don't find yourself alone in a classroom with any student male or female. I'll have one or two come talk to me privately for whatever reason and I do the same thing. I float by door in eyesight of anyone that could be in the hallway. Don't ever allow the door to be closed. Even if they're coming to you for something personal, explain to them that you have to keep the door open.  

Okay, this turned out to be significantly longer than I had imagined. I'll update if I think of more. But if you hung in this long, that already shows you care. It's fun. It's hard. Probably harder than anything you've done before, but man, seeing the lightbulb click in the faces is awesome. It's worth it if you can stick with it.    ",157,compound,0.9984,2017

It's a lonely isolated room, not much happens down there except in the art room next to it. Turns out, I went to the wrong room, and there was just an older sub sitting in the room, so I decided to just sit there and chat with him for the rest of the period. We got to talking about yearbooks and such, and he was saying how they came in handy. He could bring some to reunions for people who lost them, and just recently, he got the spelling of a name for an alum who died. He told me that the school library had all of the yearbooks there going back to the very start of the school.

Later in the day, during my free period, I decided to go check them out. Looking for my dad in them, I found some old pictures of my teachers, and even some of *their* graduation pics far back enough, and such. But then I opened to an In Memoriam page. The kids were just 15 and 17 if my memory serves. Just 15 and 17. I opened another yearbook unintentionally to another In Memoriam page for a teacher, and on the previous page, there was a whole sobering list of names of students. All who died in Vietnam. The yearbook was just from about '68, at what I understand was the height of the the war. It hit me. The sub who I was talking to said he started teaching during the 60's. He would have taught these young men, seen them at their best, and at their worst. He would have helped them graduate and cross the stage. Then years later, *just a matter of years*, he would have to grieve hearing that those same people had had their lives cut short. I never really thought about that, how teachers often have to deal with these things. Really, in terms of the war, all that high school drama is so insignificant, but we forget that everyone is an individual human being. He says he taught over 15,000 students in his years. That's a lot. He's outlived many of them, but each of them was someone he knew and taught, and each one of them is another human being, with all the emotions and personalities that a yearbook photo can hope to capture. Talking with him in that lonely classroom, I could see his eyes were watering. He talked a bit slower, choked up a few times; it was hard for him, even if he tried not to show it. He genuinely cared about each student, each of the more than 15,000 faces. Being a teacher goes beyond just teaching. If I had showed him a random picture of any student from any yearbook, he may not know their name, but he'd know them as they were as a person. My guess is that he showed up for more of their services than he'd say because of that same reason, he cares, just as you could see it behind his glasses.

So thanks to all you teachers, for not only the effort, but care you give to the thousands of lives you touch. I've never thought of a teacher outliving their students, and how hard that may be.

Instead of doing a basic ""structures of the brain and their function"" lecture, I decided to talk about mental illnesses. 

Over the course of two hours, I told them the difference between a mental illness and intellectual disability, the source of stigmas associated with mental illness, and how to identify behaviors associated with the most prevalent mental health disorders. I presented and explained to them with brain images and statistics on the rates of the diseases--including their risk factors, suicide rates, and treatment options. 

But most importantly and most impactful, I told them about my long history of Depression. I won't bore you here with the details, but it started in 6th grade for me.  I mentioned that I said and did despicable things as a depressed teenager that I regret and why I did them (I didn't get into details, however.) There were several students crying when I talked about my suicide ideation.  I practically begged them to see a parent, teacher, friend, and especially a doctor if they were experiencing any of the mental illnesses we discussed. I also emphasized that if they didn't have these feelings that their friends might--and they could and should reach out to them. ""I don't care if you hate me as a teacher, if you come talk to me about this kind of stuff, I will listen and I will care.""

I had 8 students come up to me at the end of the first period and 5 at the end of the second. 4 of those students told me they were experiencing depression or anxiety problems and that I was the first person they had ever told. I told them I would set them up with an appointment with the school psychologist--they all agreed to meet with him. I talked with one for the entire lunch period--I never really had much of a connection with him before this. He told me how frequently he thinks about suicide. He showed me one of the goodbye notes he wrote in his notebook. At the end of our conversation, he said he was going to talk to his parents about seeing a shrink.

She didn't go into much detail, but the gist is that *all women must only wear dresses*, and all men must only wear dressshirts, slacks, and ties...

As a young professional and recent graduate, I was really hoping not to have to rework my wardrobe again... I've been ""maturing"" it for the past 1.5 years and have spent almost a couple thousand dollars to date on business and business casual looks (not including dresses). I can anticipate the burden this dress code is going to cause for me.

I only have 3 dresses that are conservative enough for school, and I generally can't find dresses that are conservative AND fit me well because I am petite with broad shoulders. One of my other issues is that dresses also can't be worn multiple times or mixed for different styles, so I feel like I'm going to be forced to buy at least 10 or 15 dresses just so I can have a functional rotation between washes...

I also need to wear comfortable shoes  and limit wearing unsupportive shoes as much as possible because of my undiagnosed back pain... And when you wear dresses, it's usually expected that you have to wear heels or flats to match, which often provide little to no support... So it's more than just the dresses I'll have to buy, but any shoes I'll have to get as well if they don't match the supportive black shoes I already own.

I talked to some of my younger coworkers and they are concerned for similar reasons. Most of them, like me, don't like wearing dresses because they feel more confident in pants and prefer the range of movement they provide. I feel bad for the men as well because it can get hot in some of these classrooms, and I know ties make some men uncomfortable. I am additionally concerned for one of the new teachers who might be trans. Where might they fall on this spectrum?

I would almost be okay with this policy if the school gave us money for a specific set of clothes they wanted all the teachers to wear. But based on the limited info provided by the admin, we might have to just show up with these items already bought and ready to wear before school starts.

*Should I just suck it up and buy a bunch of dresses?* In which case, where do you go to buy affordable dresses that don't require dry cleaning?

*Or do you think I should talk to someone about my concerns?*

Danesha goes to her friend Jennifer and asks for her work so she can copy it and Jennifer, being the great friend she is, obliges her.  Danesha gets to work and brings it to me for me to check over it.  

I read over it and something is abisque about it.  I felt very clammy reading it because there was just something stroganoff about it.  

It was a list of recipes for different types of soups, pastas, and sandwiches which was meant for the culinary arts class Jennifer has and Danesha copied the entire thing.  I couldn't help myself, I was hysterically laughing for the entire period and soon so were some of the students.  Danesha took it all in good stride of course, it's just that kind of class.  

At one point, after a fair amount of crap has been given to her, she says, ""The next person that mentions clam chowder is gonna..."" and Jaython pipes up and says, ""...get a knuckle sandwich?!""

The kids are the same as they've always been. They've not changed.  It's the *school discipline* that's fallen apart and emboldened them to do what kids do:  When there are no boundaries or consequences, they exploit the *shit* out of situations to suit their own will.

What happened:

Already before 7am today I had been sworn at and called a ""dick"" for asking a group of students to move out of the way because they were blocking the door I needed to get through.  I was carrying boxes, my bag, and papers.  I had to set all that down and try to get a door open.  While also listening to them bitch at me about it.

Did the students get up, ask to help me with my load, and open the door for me?  Were they polite and respectful towards a teacher?  No.  They said it was ""rude"" and ""disrespectful"" of *me* to ask (and *expect*) them to move, that they sit there every morning, and that they wouldn't be ""moving shit.""  Well, of course, we have 2,000+ students, so I have no clue who they are, but another teacher gave me one of the girls' names.  I wrote up the girl for insubordination.  The discipline people -- who have never taught a day in their lives and are basically the students' friends -- said they couldn't figure out who else was involved.  Uh, hello?  The girl *knows* who's who, especially since *her boyfriend* is the one who called me a ""dick""!!!!  Like, I get it:  You don't ""tattle,"" but just as you can be cited for obstructing justice, they need to hold this little diva accountable for withholding information required to pursue a *serious* breach of student conduct.  If it were up to me, she'd be sitting in in-school suspension for a week doing book work without so much as a break to breathe, other than to use the toilet at a scheduled time and eat lunch by herself at her desk.  Call me harsh, but a bit of unpleasantness *does* work wonders.

Guys.  Seriously.  *This* is what's wrong with student behavior.  It's not the students.  It's the pussified adults and castrated administrators.  Until we all grow a proverbial sack and start actually disciplining according to the code of conduct, we're just going to have to deal with sassy little assholes who will fail at every junction of their lives.  And they *WILL* fail.  They will get canned like tuna from every job they get because they just can't stop running their mouths.  They'll wind up in prison because they don't realize that what flies at school doesn't fly in the real world.  They'll mouth off to a judge and be jailed for a month for contempt.  They'll try the whole ""You can't do anything because you don't know my name"" shit with a cop and get multiple charges.  It's going to happen.  It's what *WE* as a school community, riddled with social justice guilt, are teaching them.  We can talk about the school pipeline to prison all we want, but unless we acknowledge that *not* disciplining is *also* part of that pipeline (restorative discipline, anyone? LOL), we're condemning our kids to miserable lives and making our own lives worse at the same time.

*** update:  Okay-- here's what I did.

I know that others on here said not to make them write, but I think that students communicate a lot by writing. I know I have kept a journal from time to time. I asked them a series of questions while talking about my feelings about it. I sent the students out of the room to the office if they started talking over me. I am worried that I made some people in administration angry, but I have no control-- I want that control. In total, students wrote about two pages. I asked questions like, ""Nobody is going to be liked by everyone all the time. Some students dislike me, and they decided to kill my fish. What should the people who killed my fish have done if they don't like their teacher?"" and ""What do you think the fish, who felt pain and had a personality, felt when she was removed from her tank?"" Students wrote until their hands hurt. Then I told them that I don't want any apologies because at this point they would have been forced onto me by other faculty members.

I hope that I reached some kids who were angry at me, and I hope that I established maybe a little remorse in them for killing the animal. 

On another note, I just had my evaluation.  The school is not renewing my contract.

The administration makes me feel like there's something more I could do to ""connect"" with students who abuse me.  Today a student broke a laptop in my class even.  Just because...

Today my students were talking about where they focus their energy and what homework they always make sure to do and what homework they don't (they understand the material and have hw quizzes instead of getting it grading or they have limited time and have to choose).  They told me that they always make sure they have their homework done for my class because they like me and they reeeaaally don't want to disappoint.  To so many, this really wouldn't seem like a big deal but it actually meant more to me than they realize and I think many of you know why.  

I love these kids!  ",197,compound,0.9711,2017

Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!

I wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:

As technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. 

First, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.

Why? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying ""production fee"". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.

So I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for ""advertising materials"", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.

So I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.

You think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.

So after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?

So finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?

Wrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.

My blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.

So we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like ""yeah our contract is one page long."" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.

So our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.

I love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.

So on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.

I could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice.

Oh man that felt therapeutic getting out!

Edit #1: thank you to u/behemothpanzer for submitting to r/bestof , I have put so many hours into fighting this small battle that no one knew about or cared about and it really means a lot to me to see such support. I also wanted to add that I don't just have problems with Jostens, other yearbook companies have done shady things too and I don't even know them. This was from a post at the bottom of the comments about a yearbook company essentially trying to bribe me:

Another thing I didn't point out is that other companies try to lure you in with free gifts. A company told me they would [give me a free $50 gift card just for meeting with them.](http://imgur.com/dAwATtz) Like ME a gift card. I'm pretty sure that's illegal, and if not that's immoral as all hell! Greasing teachers with gift cards... unbelievable.

Oh man that felt therapeutic getting out!

Edit #1: thank you to u/behemothpanzer for submitting to r/bestof , I have put so many hours into fighting this small battle that no one knew about or cared about and it really means a lot to me to see such support. I also wanted to add that I don't just have problems with Jostens, other yearbook companies have done shady things too and I don't even know them. This was from a post at the bottom of the comments about a yearbook company essentially trying to bribe me:

Another thing I didn't point out is that other companies try to lure you in with free gifts. A company told me they would [give me a free $50 gift card just for meeting with them.](http://imgur.com/dAwATtz) Like ME a gift card. I'm pretty sure that's illegal, and if not that's immoral as all hell! Greasing teachers with gift cards... unbelievable.

Edit #3: Thank you everyone for reaching out, it means a lot to me. I tried to respond to everyone, and if I missed you I'm sorry I will try tomorrow. It's late hear but I was too pumped about your support! Goodnight and thank you!

Edit #4: In a poetic moment, I went to my school mailbox this morning [and found this!](http://imgur.com/rrlRRL9) Haha

--------------------------------------------------------------

And nobody will believe me.

Most of what we experience as teachers is out of our control. Chances are, we cannot change the administration, policies, or the other endless issues that make our jobs tough.

My second year of teaching, I realized that all I had control over, really, was my own classroom. That does not mean that I do not ever try to change anything else (I take on countless leadership opportunities in my school), but my classroom is my number one priority.

I have worked with and mentored many teachers. No matter how many warnings I give about classroom management, no matter how I model for them, they always have the same issues, and it makes their lives harder. Even on this subreddit, I am met often with defensiveness and hostility when I give advice about classroom management. I know and understand why.

My first year of teaching was terrible - seriously really bad. It was the worst and hardest year of my life. I vowed to never, ever allow my classes to be like that again, and I knew it all came down to my management.

That summer I studied every resource I could about how to manage my classes. My second year was 1,000 times better.

Now, I almost never have discipline problems, and I work with some of the toughest kids. I work in one of the poorest counties in the United States. 

I am 5'2, petite, and I probably look no older than 20. But somehow I can control students who are twice my height and kind of jerks. How?

Again and again, I can see nearly every class problem attributed to poor classroom management. Even teachers I work with who have been teaching twenty years struggle with it. They make the same mistakes over and over, and they make their lives harder. They go home exhausted. They hate their jobs.

Still, no matter how high my test scores are, no matter how great my classes are, there is nothing I can do to get most teachers to believe me. But, if you are one of the teachers reading this, who does believe me, read my advice below.

Just to note, as we approach the end of the year, it will probably be really hard to change much (not that it is hopeless), so focus on what you can change for next year. Also, this post is not just for little kids. All of this stuff can apply to all grade levels, even high school! Here are my tips that have never failed me. 

**Day 1, Week 1** 

Everything, and I mean everything you do, on the first week of school will affect the rest of your year. You must plan this week accordingly. I recommend that you have all your process and procedures built into your week one lessons. I do NOT care what age level the students are. If you notice on this subreddit, 1st graders need this as much as 9th graders.

Figure out how you want your classroom to operate...every detail. I make my students take notes on my classroom procedures and policies on the first day, and throughout the week, I have them practice. The first week is great for correcting students. Did not enter your classroom correctly? Make them enter again. 

This does not mean my first week is spent only on processes and procedures. I integrate them directly into my lessons. Want students to work in groups? Show them how the first day and make them practice! Want students to talk? Have them talk the first day.

**Consistency**

Everything you do from this point on must be in line with what you set up your first week. Many teachers start off strong, but then they become more lenient. Do NOT start being nice about your rules for any reason. I tell my students that I do not care if it is the first day of school or the last. If they break my rules, there will be consequences.

**Positive Classroom Environment**

This starts with day one. I use Positive Behavior Supports (PBS). Look it up. I would say 90% of my interactions with students are positive. I notice what they are doing right. That does not mean I never call students out or deal with issues, but I always do my best to use positive language. This is not easy and I still slip, especially with hard classes. However, my students, no matter who they are, respond well to this. Of course, it has to start from day one. Examples:

*I love how Johnny started working right away.

*Thank you for entering my classroom quietly.

*Wow, this group is working so hard. I really appreciate that.

It comes off as corny, but I do not care. I use it to address both individuals, groups, and a class as a whole. 

Really look at your language. Is it mostly positive or mostly negative? Set a goal for yourself. I try to notice 5 good things each class.

**Mutual Respect**

I have four major rules in my classes, and the processes and procedures are how those rules are carried out. 

Think about the major rules that will promote a positive learning environment. My number one rule is the golden rule, and that seems to encompass nearly everything.

On the first day, I say something like this:

*In life, you are not going to like everybody you work with. You are not going to like every teacher. You do not even have to like me. But, we should always have respect for each other. We are going to have good days and bad days, but it is always about respect.*

This automatically stops the students from acting out simply because they do not like you. Although I wish every student would like me, that just is not going to happen, and I am not going to like every student. We can still have respect for each other though. And chances are, if we really work on that respect, we end up liking each other.

**Relationships with Parents**

Do not treat parents as enemies. I see teachers do this all wrong. People can say I am weak, but I usually bend toward the needs of parents unless their wants are truly unreasonable.

If parents like you, their kids will likely like you. If parents like you, they are more likely to go to you with concerns than to administration. If parents like you, they are more likely to dismiss your mistakes. 

Pick and choose your battles wisely. If a parent emails me and asks for a reasonable extension on an assignment for their student, I say yes. I am not going to waste two days fighting over one assignment.

I know there are unreasonable requests, and you have to decide your threshold. But overall, I really work with parents or at least negotiate with them.

Make sure your first interaction with parents is positive before PTC. Find a way to either call them or meet them beforehand. Be creative. I did a family night this year, and it was early enough in the year that the interactions could be postive. I do tell parents something like this (corny but I do not care):

*I love the relationships I form with students and parents. If I am ever having any issues or concern with your student, you will be the first to know.*

And it is true (consistency). So much can be solved from a simple phone call. After the first few weeks, you know who your trouble-makers are. Call home.

When talking to parents frame it likes this:

*Positive: Always start on a positive note.

*Negative: Address the issue

*Positive: End on a positive note and always thank them for their support.

This work with emails, phone calls, PTC, etc.

Do not make parents your enemy. I am not saying that I have never had bad interactions with parents, but I would say that I have had 99% percent positive interactions due to the mentality that we are on the same team.

**Do Not Become a Dictator**

Rules are important, but I see some teachers go crazy with them. Now you have to do what your administration wants you to do, and there is no choice in the matter. However, nothing is perfect and neither are your students. Pick and choose your battles wisely. 

For example, let's say you have a no food rule, but your student is truly working and they are quickly eating a cookie. How do you address this? I usually go about doing it this way:

""I wanted to remind you that we have a no food rule. However, I can tell you are working and are not making a mess. In the future, though, do not bring food.""

I have seen teachers lose their shit over stuff like this. If it happens again after that point, then I will follow through and ask them to remove the food. The two things that matter are how you frame your language and what battles are worth fighting.

Chances are if you address situations postively and respectively, they will work out.

I see teachers who are feared and yell constantly. That is fine if that is your style, but I do not want to have a heart attack before I am 40. 

Save your mean voice for when it is really needed. I rarely yell, but when I do, the students listen.

**I have tried everything and...**

If you truly have followed what I mentioned above, and you still have issues with a student, then you need to make a plan with administration and parents. This means that you have done every intervention (call home, counseling referral, conference, etc.) and this student has not changed.

This means there is usually more the story. You need to completely understand the rules and procedues in your school and how situations like this are addressed. If I have done everything I can for a student, and it still is not working, then it becomes an administration issue.

I am lucky to work in a school where the admin is pretty good about discipline, but even I think they give too many chances. That is why I set up my classroom so that they are my last resort. I would rather deal with parents than admin, and I like my admin! 

Chances are a lot of you work in schools with crappy admin. That is why it is so important that you set up your classroom so you have to deal with them as little as possible. I really like to keep my interactions with them minimal. Plus, they love that I give them less work.

This year I have only had one student where I referred. I did every intervention I could, and it was just not working. When I finally went to admin, I had all this evidence to show that I did what I could, and now it is in their hands. 

Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I see teachers use the same strategy with a difficult student, even if it is not working. If it is not working, stop doing it!

**Off days**

Even your best students will have bad days. Pick and choose how you handle the sitation. 

Let's say one of your students just broke up with their boyfriend and they are super depressed. Should I scream at them to take notes? Or can I talk to them one on one and give them an alternative?

I usually say something like this:

""Normally you are so on task, but I can tell something is wrong. Today I will let this slide, but could you maybe write a letter about how you are feeling so I understand? If not, I need you to take the notes. Maybe go take a quick break and them come back and do what you need to do.""

Some students write the letter and some take the notes. The point is, I work with them.

Most behavior issues are usually due to something outside your classroom, and a gentle but firm approach works much better than screaming.

**Breaks and Rewards**

Build in breaks and rewards. I know this goes against what you probably hear, but hear me out.

As for breaks, if I see my students really hyper, sometimes I turn off the lights and tell them to ""be bored and clear their mind"" for a minute or two. This really works! I do not allow them to talk during this time, and then I turn the lights back on what it is calmer. 

Also, ensure that there are transitions built into your lessons. Do not ever lecture for more than 20 minutes unless you are the world's best speaker. If you are going to lecture the whole period, build in breaks into the lecture (think pair share, a video, etc.)

A lot of teachers are against rewarding students, but I am not. Some things I do that work:

*Write little notes and give the student the note as I walk by. This helps the ""cool kids"" who do not want to be embarrassed.

*Classroom incentives: You can do nearly anything here. Usually I do something with attitude or behavior, and then we have a classroom movie/party. Ask me more about how I do this because I know admin. are crazy about wasted class time.

*Random treat days: Example: ""You guys have been working so hard all week, so I brought popcorn in for everybody today. Thank you so much.""

Yes it costs me money, but to me it is worth it. Clearly I do not do this all the time.

*Student of the Month/Character Traits: Do not wait for admin or grade level to do all the honoring. I use ""character report cards"" to honor students of the month in my class. I choose a character trait (optimism, zest, etc.) and honor two students per class per month. You can go anywhere you want with this! Give them a cheap certificate and a sucker. They will be happy (any age!)

*Be creative: You do not have to wait for something big to reward a student! Example:

""Andrew, I can tell you have been really improving since our last conversation a week ago. Here is a free homework pass. Thank you!""

**Controlled Chaos**

Sometimes your classroom will get loud. Sometimes it will get off topic. Sometimes kids mess around. Can you bring them back? That is the important question.

Have a quiet signal. I do not care what it is, but keep it consistent and use it all year. I use ""Give Me 5"" and it works, even with my 8th graders, right now during this terrible time of the year.

As long as I can bring my students back, I know I have control.

**Conclusion**

I could keep going and going and going. If you really think about it, this is all about psychology. When you are working with people, even students, use psychology! Everything I posted here can be backed up by actual research, and this is not me just making up stuff.

Still, no matter how many times I work with teachers, they would rather find out the hard way.

As the end of the year closes, what in your class needs to change? Did you have processes and procedures this year? Were you consistent? What worked and what did not? Do you truly have classroom management?

I am willing to help anybody here. I am willing to clarify anything. Ask me absolutely anything!

And remember, be yourself. Take what is good about who you are and bring it into your teaching. I love photography and post photos I took all around. I have a dark sense of humor and love joking with my students. I am a neat freak and short and I make fun of myself. You do not have to be a robot!

It is never going to be perfect. As I wrap up this year, I already know one or two changes I need to make. Still, I always have the foundation of things that have worked over the years. Everything that I have mentioned in this post works.

Pick and choose your battles wisely. If a parent emails me and asks for a reasonable extension on an assignment for their student, I say yes. I am not going to waste two days fighting over one assignment.

I know there are unreasonable requests, and you have to decide your threshold. But overall, I really work with parents or at least negotiate with them.

Make sure your first interaction with parents is positive before PTC. Find a way to either call them or meet them beforehand. Be creative. I did a family night this year, and it was early enough in the year that the interactions could be postive. I do tell parents something like this (corny but I do not care):

*I love the relationships I form with students and parents. If I am ever having any issues or concern with your student, you will be the first to know.*

And it is true (consistency). So much can be solved from a simple phone call. After the first few weeks, you know who your trouble-makers are. Call home.

When talking to parents frame it likes this:

*Positive: Always start on a positive note.

*Negative: Address the issue

*Positive: End on a positive note and always thank them for their support.

This work with emails, phone calls, PTC, etc.

Do not make parents your enemy. I am not saying that I have never had bad interactions with parents, but I would say that I have had 99% percent positive interactions due to the mentality that we are on the same team.

**Do Not Become a Dictator**

Rules are important, but I see some teachers go crazy with them. Now you have to do what your administration wants you to do, and there is no choice in the matter. However, nothing is perfect and neither are your students. Pick and choose your battles wisely. 

For example, let's say you have a no food rule, but your student is truly working and they are quickly eating a cookie. How do you address this? I usually go about doing it this way:

""I wanted to remind you that we have a no food rule. However, I can tell you are working and are not making a mess. In the future, though, do not bring food.""

I have seen teachers lose their shit over stuff like this. If it happens again after that point, then I will follow through and ask them to remove the food. The two things that matter are how you frame your language and what battles are worth fighting.

Chances are if you address situations postively and respectively, they will work out.

I see teachers who are feared and yell constantly. That is fine if that is your style, but I do not want to have a heart attack before I am 40. 

Save your mean voice for when it is really needed. I rarely yell, but when I do, the students listen.

**I have tried everything and...**

If you truly have followed what I mentioned above, and you still have issues with a student, then you need to make a plan with administration and parents. This means that you have done every intervention (call home, counseling referral, conference, etc.) and this student has not changed.

This means there is usually more the story. You need to completely understand the rules and procedues in your school and how situations like this are addressed. If I have done everything I can for a student, and it still is not working, then it becomes an administration issue.

I am lucky to work in a school where the admin is pretty good about discipline, but even I think they give too many chances. That is why I set up my classroom so that they are my last resort. I would rather deal with parents than admin, and I like my admin! 

Chances are a lot of you work in schools with crappy admin. That is why it is so important that you set up your classroom so you have to deal with them as little as possible. I really like to keep my interactions with them minimal. Plus, they love that I give them less work.

This year I have only had one student where I referred. I did every intervention I could, and it was just not working. When I finally went to admin, I had all this evidence to show that I did what I could, and now it is in their hands. 

Remember, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I see teachers use the same strategy with a difficult student, even if it is not working. If it is not working, stop doing it!

**Off days**

Even your best students will have bad days. Pick and choose how you handle the sitation. 

Let's say one of your students just broke up with their boyfriend and they are super depressed. Should I scream at them to take notes? Or can I talk to them one on one and give them an alternative?

I usually say something like this:

""Normally you are so on task, but I can tell something is wrong. Today I will let this slide, but could you maybe write a letter about how you are feeling so I understand? If not, I need you to take the notes. Maybe go take a quick break and them come back and do what you need to do.""

Some students write the letter and some take the notes. The point is, I work with them.

Most behavior issues are usually due to something outside your classroom, and a gentle but firm approach works much better than screaming.

**Breaks and Rewards**

Build in breaks and rewards. I know this goes against what you probably hear, but hear me out.

As for breaks, if I see my students really hyper, sometimes I turn off the lights and tell them to ""be bored and clear their mind"" for a minute or two. This really works! I do not allow them to talk during this time, and then I turn the lights back on what it is calmer. 

Also, ensure that there are transitions built into your lessons. Do not ever lecture for more than 20 minutes unless you are the world's best speaker. If you are going to lecture the whole period, build in breaks into the lecture (think pair share, a video, etc.)

A lot of teachers are against rewarding students, but I am not. Some things I do that work:

*Write little notes and give the student the note as I walk by. This helps the ""cool kids"" who do not want to be embarrassed.

*Classroom incentives: You can do nearly anything here. Usually I do something with attitude or behavior, and then we have a classroom movie/party. Ask me more about how I do this because I know admin. are crazy about wasted class time.

*Random treat days: Example: ""You guys have been working so hard all week, so I brought popcorn in for everybody today. Thank you so much.""

Yes it costs me money, but to me it is worth it. Clearly I do not do this all the time.

*Student of the Month/Character Traits: Do not wait for admin or grade level to do all the honoring. I use ""character report cards"" to honor students of the month in my class. I choose a character trait (optimism, zest, etc.) and honor two students per class per month. You can go anywhere you want with this! Give them a cheap certificate and a sucker. They will be happy (any age!)

*Be creative: You do not have to wait for something big to reward a student! Example:

""Andrew, I can tell you have been really improving since our last conversation a week ago. Here is a free homework pass. Thank you!""

**Controlled Chaos**

Sometimes your classroom will get loud. Sometimes it will get off topic. Sometimes kids mess around. Can you bring them back? That is the important question.

Have a quiet signal. I do not care what it is, but keep it consistent and use it all year. I use ""Give Me 5"" and it works, even with my 8th graders, right now during this terrible time of the year.

As long as I can bring my students back, I know I have control.

**Conclusion**

I could keep going and going and going. If you really think about it, this is all about psychology. When you are working with people, even students, use psychology! Everything I posted here can be backed up by actual research, and this is not me just making up stuff.

Still, no matter how many times I work with teachers, they would rather find out the hard way.

As the end of the year closes, what in your class needs to change? Did you have processes and procedures this year? Were you consistent? What worked and what did not? Do you truly have classroom management?

I am willing to help anybody here. I am willing to clarify anything. Ask me absolutely anything!

And remember, be yourself. Take what is good about who you are and bring it into your teaching. I love photography and post photos I took all around. I have a dark sense of humor and love joking with my students. I am a neat freak and short and I make fun of myself. You do not have to be a robot!

It is never going to be perfect. As I wrap up this year, I already know one or two changes I need to make. Still, I always have the foundation of things that have worked over the years. Everything that I have mentioned in this post works.

I hope this post can help at least one person.",204,compound,0.9997,2017

I feel like it is rarely said but I really mean it. A couple of days ago, a teacher from our school named Mrs. Eddy passed away due to cancer. We had all known about it. Hell, when I had her for Honors English 11, she would sometimes have to miss class for chemotherapy sessions.

It saddens me to think about the fact that I never got to tell her that.

On Saturday, I had a meeting with my boss and I had my lawyer and union leader by my side. This was about my relationship with a former student who graduated 12 years ago, my boss tried his hardest to make it out like I had feelings for him when he was my student and then he tried his best to find reasons to fire me. 

He said that he does not want the school to be known as the place where a teacher and a student fell in love, despite the fact that we didn't when he was a student, it was 12 years later. Long story short, he lost his case and now, his place at the school is in jeopardy and I'm going to receive a good amount of money from this case. 

I can now live my life without worrying about my job, my boyfriend and I are having a great time now and we are thinking of taking a nice long vacation soon. 

I've been teaching since I was 24 and this had to be one of the most ridiculous things that has ever happened to me. I don't know what it's like for the rest of you, but this was a really weird case.

At the beginning of each block I like to talk to my students. I don’t give them any directions; I don’t tell them anything important. We just talk.

I ask about weekends, sports, family, current events, and anything else that might be of interest at the moment. The only topic that seems to be off limits is English. When a class is new, they don’t know how to respond to this. They shift in their seats and glance at their friends.

I siege them with questions. I hurl shot after shot into the room and latch onto what they throw back. Early in the year I’m satisfied with a couple of timid answers. After a brief statement about a birthday party or a complaint about work, I downshift and the class lurches into English mode. 

Eventually they talk back. 

**Talking Back**

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate. They no longer wait for my questions, but instead go on the offensive. Sometimes I’m flattered (when students want to know how I met my smoking hot wife). Other times I’m agitated (when students resolutely defended the stance that advertising had no effect on their lives.) Mostly, though, I enjoy a casual camaraderie with my class as I share interesting things I either know about (like the inevitable [house centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata)), or things I’ve been thinking about (anything from the value of dogs to [why female students have better handwriting than male](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2xwhhj/why_do_girls_tend_to_have_better_handwriting_than/)). They piggyback off my stories and share experiences of their own; they piggyback off my ideas and share ideas of their own.

As the year goes on, I inevitably see students grin widely. They ask questions about things that they suspect I might want to speak at-length about. *He’s doing it again*, they think as they ask about my projects, my travel, my outfit. *We waste so much time in this class.*

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

If tasked to defend this getting-to-know-you time, say, in front of an administrator, I might speak at some length about the conversational skills it builds. Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers. I could argue that I am modelling good conversation skills and hitting speaking and listening standards in the process.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own.

It's a lonely isolated room, not much happens down there except in the art room next to it. Turns out, I went to the wrong room, and there was just an older sub sitting in the room, so I decided to just sit there and chat with him for the rest of the period. We got to talking about yearbooks and such, and he was saying how they came in handy. He could bring some to reunions for people who lost them, and just recently, he got the spelling of a name for an alum who died. He told me that the school library had all of the yearbooks there going back to the very start of the school.

Later in the day, during my free period, I decided to go check them out. Looking for my dad in them, I found some old pictures of my teachers, and even some of *their* graduation pics far back enough, and such. But then I opened to an In Memoriam page. The kids were just 15 and 17 if my memory serves. Just 15 and 17. I opened another yearbook unintentionally to another In Memoriam page for a teacher, and on the previous page, there was a whole sobering list of names of students. All who died in Vietnam. The yearbook was just from about '68, at what I understand was the height of the the war. It hit me. The sub who I was talking to said he started teaching during the 60's. He would have taught these young men, seen them at their best, and at their worst. He would have helped them graduate and cross the stage. Then years later, *just a matter of years*, he would have to grieve hearing that those same people had had their lives cut short. I never really thought about that, how teachers often have to deal with these things. Really, in terms of the war, all that high school drama is so insignificant, but we forget that everyone is an individual human being. He says he taught over 15,000 students in his years. That's a lot. He's outlived many of them, but each of them was someone he knew and taught, and each one of them is another human being, with all the emotions and personalities that a yearbook photo can hope to capture. Talking with him in that lonely classroom, I could see his eyes were watering. He talked a bit slower, choked up a few times; it was hard for him, even if he tried not to show it. He genuinely cared about each student, each of the more than 15,000 faces. Being a teacher goes beyond just teaching. If I had showed him a random picture of any student from any yearbook, he may not know their name, but he'd know them as they were as a person. My guess is that he showed up for more of their services than he'd say because of that same reason, he cares, just as you could see it behind his glasses.

So thanks to all you teachers, for not only the effort, but care you give to the thousands of lives you touch. I've never thought of a teacher outliving their students, and how hard that may be.

I read over it and something is abisque about it.  I felt very clammy reading it because there was just something stroganoff about it.  

It was a list of recipes for different types of soups, pastas, and sandwiches which was meant for the culinary arts class Jennifer has and Danesha copied the entire thing.  I couldn't help myself, I was hysterically laughing for the entire period and soon so were some of the students.  Danesha took it all in good stride of course, it's just that kind of class.

Danesha goes to her friend Jennifer and asks for her work so she can copy it and Jennifer, being the great friend she is, obliges her.  Danesha gets to work and brings it to me for me to check over it.  

I read over it and something is abisque about it.  I felt very clammy reading it because there was just something stroganoff about it.  

It was a list of recipes for different types of soups, pastas, and sandwiches which was meant for the culinary arts class Jennifer has and Danesha copied the entire thing.  I couldn't help myself, I was hysterically laughing for the entire period and soon so were some of the students.  Danesha took it all in good stride of course, it's just that kind of class.

The kids are the same as they've always been. They've not changed.  It's the *school discipline* that's fallen apart and emboldened them to do what kids do:  When there are no boundaries or consequences, they exploit the *shit* out of situations to suit their own will.

What happened:

Already before 7am today I had been sworn at and called a ""dick"" for asking a group of students to move out of the way because they were blocking the door I needed to get through.  I was carrying boxes, my bag, and papers.  I had to set all that down and try to get a door open.  While also listening to them bitch at me about it.

Did the students get up, ask to help me with my load, and open the door for me?  Were they polite and respectful towards a teacher?  No.  They said it was ""rude"" and ""disrespectful"" of *me* to ask (and *expect*) them to move, that they sit there every morning, and that they wouldn't be ""moving shit.""  Well, of course, we have 2,000+ students, so I have no clue who they are, but another teacher gave me one of the girls' names.  I wrote up the girl for insubordination.  The discipline people -- who have never taught a day in their lives and are basically the students' friends -- said they couldn't figure out who else was involved.  Uh, hello?  The girl *knows* who's who, especially since *her boyfriend* is the one who called me a ""dick""!!!!  Like, I get it:  You don't ""tattle,"" but just as you can be cited for obstructing justice, they need to hold this little diva accountable for withholding information required to pursue a *serious* breach of student conduct.  If it were up to me, she'd be sitting in in-school suspension for a week doing book work without so much as a break to breathe, other than to use the toilet at a scheduled time and eat lunch by herself at her desk.  Call me harsh, but a bit of unpleasantness *does* work wonders.

Guys.  Seriously.  *This* is what's wrong with student behavior.  It's not the students.  It's the pussified adults and castrated administrators.  Until we all grow a proverbial sack and start actually disciplining according to the code of conduct, we're just going to have to deal with sassy little assholes who will fail at every junction of their lives.  And they *WILL* fail.  They will get canned like tuna from every job they get because they just can't stop running their mouths.  They'll wind up in prison because they don't realize that what flies at school doesn't fly in the real world.  They'll mouth off to a judge and be jailed for a month for contempt.  They'll try the whole ""You can't do anything because you don't know my name"" shit with a cop and get multiple charges.  It's going to happen.  It's what *WE* as a school community, riddled with social justice guilt, are teaching them.  We can talk about the school pipeline to prison all we want, but unless we acknowledge that *not* disciplining is *also* part of that pipeline (restorative discipline, anyone?

I am an ed tech assigned to general recess to monitor ONE 2nd grade student with aggression/behavioral needs who is constantly in trouble for pushing and hitting. I basically follow him all recess. 

   I have noticed there were 2 students that seem to always be on the receiving end of my students aggression, and through watching the recess behavior for a week learning their ""play habits"" I have discovered that they are ALWAYS in his face! SO I started watching THOSE 2 kids and have discovered that they will come from across the playground to instigate the aggression with my student. 

   So today those 2 kids got to meet Mama Bear! (my nickname when I work with the rec dept for being the one in charge of discipline LOL) I caught them in the act, with another teacher as a witness, they then tried to lie to my face and say my student started it. I put them on the wall for 5 min, and when they both gave me sass I made it 10, continued to yell at me and sass from the wall so the other teacher gave them the WHOLE recess!

   After recess is normally my lunch, however I took all 3 boys to the office after explaining to my student that he was NOT in trouble, just that he needed to tell HIS side of what happened to the superintendent. He told the admin what happened, I told the admin what I have observed. Then the 2 instigators came in and tried lying to the admin with me right there! I called them out on it and the admin warned them that if they lied he would double the punishment and that he would be checking their ""stories"" with the other recess staff, they continued to lie and got caught in their lies by me and the other staff, and have had their parents called, no recess tomorrow or Monday and if they do it again they will get suspended!

   It was completely worth giving up my lunch when walking down the hallway, my student turned to me and hugged me and said, ""thank you for speaking up for me Miss Jaci, I know you will help keep me safe and I like you!"" and this is a kid that is NOT affectionate, so it was pretty awesome to get his hug!",False,False,Teachers,t5_2qqcs,,self,Put my foot down at recess today!

SO I started watching THOSE 2 kids and have discovered that they will come from across the playground to instigate the aggression with my student. 

   So today those 2 kids got to meet Mama Bear! (my nickname when I work with the rec dept for being the one in charge of discipline LOL) I caught them in the act, with another teacher as a witness, they then tried to lie to my face and say my student started it. I put them on the wall for 5 min, and when they both gave me sass I made it 10, continued to yell at me and sass from the wall so the other teacher gave them the WHOLE recess!

   After recess is normally my lunch, however I took all 3 boys to the office after explaining to my student that he was NOT in trouble, just that he needed to tell HIS side of what happened to the superintendent. He told the admin what happened, I told the admin what I have observed. Then the 2 instigators came in and tried lying to the admin with me right there! I called them out on it and the admin warned them that if they lied he would double the punishment and that he would be checking their ""stories"" with the other recess staff, they continued to lie and got caught in their lies by me and the other staff, and have had their parents called, no recess tomorrow or Monday and if they do it again they will get suspended!

   It was completely worth giving up my lunch when walking down the hallway, my student turned to me and hugged me and said, ""thank you for speaking up for me Miss Jaci, I know you will help keep me safe and I like you!"" and this is a kid that is NOT affectionate, so it was pretty awesome to get his hug!",263,compound,0.8687,2017

*Quick setting imagery:  I am a 25 year old white male, who is teaching the youth of the South Side of Chicago for the first time, this year.  I had taught seniors for the first quarter, but was let go do to budget cuts, and picked up by the same network to teach Algebra and Geometry, in October.*

As the volume started to elevate exponentially, a few of my more vocal boys began to stem their conversation into something laden with heavy profanity.  It was after the first F-bomb, that I began to turn my attention to them.  Then the N-words started to fly.  Not the term often used between friends, but rather the one with a hard ""r"" ending.  I became increasingly uncomfortable and jumped in.

""All right!  Enough!  Now, I know today we have a little freedom in our work, but I should not have to be writing referrals with the n-word plastered all over them for the deans and your parents to see!"" ...is what I wanted to say.  That didn't happen...

Oh, my God.  No.  No no no no.  A chill shot down my spine, my face grew hot.  And it was as if every pore in my opened up to unleash a billion beads of sweat across my entire being.

I put my face in my hands.  Maybe they hadn't heard it?  Maybe this was just another time they tuned me out.  

Nope.  As if they could sense it to be coming, a lull came across the room as I was redirecting the young men.  This was the end.  This is how I, 1. Get fired, or 2. Lose their respect forever

But!  By the grace of the Lord above, they burst out in laughter.  One of my more difficult girls came up and patted me on the back, consoling me.  The boy who had said the words over and over, fake stormed out of the room, but came back in laughing and gave me a nice high five.  I received about 4 more hugs and a flurry of fist bumps the remainder of class.  Remarkable.

This has been my most difficult class all year.  We have had heart to hearts, tough love, everything.  I watched 14 of them drop their grade from quarter 2 to quarter 3, and my confidence with them was shot.  But, today...today it came together in a moment that could have (maybe even should have?) been horrendous.

Fellow history teachers, we have one in every class: the kid who's ~~crazy about~~ genuinely interested by military history. Always has the correct answer when called upon, always is the first one with a hand up.

And sometimes, through no malice of his own, ""Kevin"" can be a tad condescending when he shares a tidbit of information with his classmates. 

It turns out that Kevin really enjoyed the unit on WWI, was a little bored with the 20s and the Great Depression, but there was light at the end of the tunnel. His eyes lit up -- and his hand went up -- in  class during the lessons on fascism, Stalinism and the rise of Hitler. Then we did Hitler's conquests in the late 30s and Kevin was jubilating: WWII was about to start. He knew it, 29 other students knew it, I knew it. ""We start the WWII unit tomorrow,"" I told him as he left my classroom.

The next day, 29 students are in the classroom and Kevin is not there: he's got a &lt;insert a sport here&gt; tournament.  

I told the students about the joke we were about to pull. The trust level and respect in this class of high achievers is quite high. I got a classmate, ""Linda"", to text to Kevin -- in the middle of the lesson -- something like ""Mr. Corbeau_from_Orleans' WWII jokes are actually funny!""

Then, I wrote a post on the class' Classroom page, set to be published automatically five minutes after the end of the period. And I knew that Kevin would see the update on his phone.

""Congratulations to all of you in class, your concentration and on-task behavior was excellent -- despite my frequent jokes and your laughs. I'm very proud that I was able to cover the whole of WWII in one period. WWII summative test is Friday. Tomorrow, we start the Cold War unit. Linda, remember you have detention with me. Don't ever text again during class.""

At the end of the school day, I published a WWII unit study guide on Classroom with the message ""To help you guys study for Friday's test...""

The next day, last period, Kevin walked up to me and asked ""What did I miss yesterday?"" and I replied dryly, as I was shuffling papers on my desk, ""World War II from one end to the other. Test is on Friday. Come see me after class for the missing handouts.""

The bell rang, and as planned with the rest of the class, I'm ready to start the Cold War unit. But before I do, I told the class ""Class, you were great yesterday. You laughed at my jokes, paid attention like never before, asked very good questions, participated very well. In my 10 years of teaching, it was my Best. Lesson. Ever. It's periods like that, and students like you, that are the reason why I'm so very happy when I get to the school in the morning.""

I then went at it like a bat out of hell, running through the beginning of the Cold War, the students sitting close to Kevin were frantically taking notes, the others who are out of sight were faking it. After five minutes, right on cue, ""Mary"" raises her hand and says: 

""Kevin, we like you very much and we know that you love WWII history. That's why we pranked you and made as if we had covered the whole unit in a lesson. But we only saw a little bit yesterday and we hope you enjoy the many lessons Mr. Corbeau_from_Orleans has for us. Kevin, don't change a bit.""

After school I get called into the office and the principal informs me that this happened. She says she heard the recording and, in her words, ""that wasn't even worth recording. You didn't even say anything bad"" and she even said ""that yelling was pathetic. That's the best you got?"" Kind of as a joke to make me feel better.

She already had M's phone and as we spoke, the phone got a text from someone who even said ""is that all? I thought you said she cussed. That was nothing.""

I'm always careful not to say anything I'll regret.

The younger grades realized how much I incorporate math and reading and other content areas. Kids who don't read or write complete sentences can read music and translate it into body percussion. Those kids got to feel really proud today. Music is so much more than singing songs, and now my colleagues know. It just feels good to be recognized for the hard work that no one sees. Fourth grade works their asses off and their math scores go up, theres a graph. First graders read rhythms at a 4th grade level, theres no graph.  
Even if this only happens once this year, its awesome that THEY know we don't sit in a circle and sing nursery rhymes all day. ",304,compound,0.9727,2017

I feel like it is rarely said but I really mean it. A couple of days ago, a teacher from our school named Mrs. Eddy passed away due to cancer. We had all known about it. Hell, when I had her for Honors English 11, she would sometimes have to miss class for chemotherapy sessions. At the beginning of the school year, she took an extended leave which turned out to be indefinite. 

The reason I say this is because Mrs. Eddy was one of the few teachers I actually gave a shit about. She was the first person to EVER care about my writing and inspired me to read and write like no other teacher did. I got back into poetry and screenplay writing because of her. 

I am not going to say that she changed my life or that she was that one teacher that inspired me to be great. That shit is for the movies. However, she was a great teacher, a wonderful person, and a kind soul.

It saddens me to think about the fact that I never got to tell her that. 

So for all the teachers out there who wake up every morning, and inspire, thank you. I know it's not easy. Teaching isn't an easy job. I couldn't do it, especially if I had cancer. 

Mrs. Eddy, my thoughts are with you tonight.

And to all other teachers, thank you for everything you do.

At the beginning of each block I like to talk to my students. I don’t give them any directions; I don’t tell them anything important. We just talk. 

The moment the starting bell rings, I’ll lean back on the table in the front of my room and lob questions. I ask about weekends, sports, family, current events, and anything else that might be of interest at the moment. The only topic that seems to be off limits is English. When a class is new, they don’t know how to respond to this. They shift in their seats and glance at their friends. Eventually a brazen student will throw an answer back and a chuckle will drip drip drip through the room before shutting to silence. I’ll press on, though. I ask about jobs, and interests. I ask about boyfriends and girlfriends. I ask about pets. Students love talking about pets.

I siege them with questions. I hurl shot after shot into the room and latch onto what they throw back. Early in the year I’m satisfied with a couple of timid answers. After a brief statement about a birthday party or a complaint about work, I downshift and the class lurches into English mode. 

Eventually they talk back. 

**Talking Back**

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate. They no longer wait for my questions, but instead go on the offensive. Sometimes I’m flattered (when students want to know how I met my smoking hot wife). Other times I’m agitated (when students resolutely defended the stance that advertising had no effect on their lives.) Mostly, though, I enjoy a casual camaraderie with my class as I share interesting things I either know about (like the inevitable [house centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata)), or things I’ve been thinking about (anything from the value of dogs to [why female students have better handwriting than male](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2xwhhj/why_do_girls_tend_to_have_better_handwriting_than/)). They piggyback off my stories and share experiences of their own; they piggyback off my ideas and share ideas of their own.

As the year goes on, I inevitably see students grin widely. They ask questions about things that they suspect I might want to speak at-length about. *He’s doing it again*, they think as they ask about my projects, my travel, my outfit. *We waste so much time in this class.*

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

If tasked to defend this getting-to-know-you time, say, in front of an administrator, I might speak at some length about the conversational skills it builds. Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers. I could argue that I am modelling good conversation skills and hitting speaking and listening standards in the process.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own. This is why we waste time in my classroom.",False,False,Teachers,t5_2qqcs,,self,"Thoughts on Teaching: Community is Everything, Dumbass.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/5lvnja/thoughts_on_teaching_community_is_everything/,1483506979.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-04 00:16:19+00:00,"Thoughts on Teaching: Community is Everything, Dumbass.I waste time in my classroom. At the beginning of each block I like to talk to my students. I don’t give them any directions; I don’t tell them anything important. We just talk. 

The moment the starting bell rings, I’ll lean back on the table in the front of my room and lob questions. I ask about weekends, sports, family, current events, and anything else that might be of interest at the moment. The only topic that seems to be off limits is English. When a class is new, they don’t know how to respond to this. They shift in their seats and glance at their friends. Eventually a brazen student will throw an answer back and a chuckle will drip drip drip through the room before shutting to silence. I’ll press on, though. I ask about jobs, and interests. I ask about boyfriends and girlfriends. I ask about pets. Students love talking about pets.

I siege them with questions. I hurl shot after shot into the room and latch onto what they throw back. Early in the year I’m satisfied with a couple of timid answers. After a brief statement about a birthday party or a complaint about work, I downshift and the class lurches into English mode. 

Eventually they talk back. 

**Talking Back**

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate. They no longer wait for my questions, but instead go on the offensive. Sometimes I’m flattered (when students want to know how I met my smoking hot wife). Other times I’m agitated (when students resolutely defended the stance that advertising had no effect on their lives.) Mostly, though, I enjoy a casual camaraderie with my class as I share interesting things I either know about (like the inevitable [house centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata)), or things I’ve been thinking about (anything from the value of dogs to [why female students have better handwriting than male](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2xwhhj/why_do_girls_tend_to_have_better_handwriting_than/)). They piggyback off my stories and share experiences of their own; they piggyback off my ideas and share ideas of their own.

As the year goes on, I inevitably see students grin widely. They ask questions about things that they suspect I might want to speak at-length about. *He’s doing it again*, they think as they ask about my projects, my travel, my outfit. *We waste so much time in this class.*

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

If tasked to defend this getting-to-know-you time, say, in front of an administrator, I might speak at some length about the conversational skills it builds. Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers. I could argue that I am modelling good conversation skills and hitting speaking and listening standards in the process.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

The question was: ""What is a project that you've seen from students in the last month that amazed you?""

Some sample responses I got were:
""Hm. Interesting question. I think it's reading. Yeah, reading has been the project that has amazed me the most.""

""We track our students' reading levels on a big bulletin board outside. What's amazing has been watching their growth.""

""Well, we've moved away from fluffy projects. They do little to increase student achievement and understanding. We're more interested in cultivating students that can analyze and write about text.""

This year, my team taught our third graders about the encounter between the Spanish and the Inca.

We taught the students how to weave like the Inca. They spent hours on their craft during their free time, going over and under, over and under. They thought about what colors would go well together and complimented each other on their beautiful pieces. We created gold artifacts, like the Inca made for their temples. And we asked ourselves, does gold still have value if it isn't used for money?

We divided the class into two made up cultures, Hokies and Heelots, each with their own made-up customs and ways of interacting that purposefully contradicted the other (one culture makes eye contact, the other does not, etc), and we had them interact to experience cultural disconnect and reflect on it.

Half the class created art out of random twigs, stones, and leaves we found on the playground, and then the other half of the class came and created their own art, not realizing they had destroyed the other half's creations. And we asked, who owns nature? Is it okay for new cultures to change another culture's art? Is it destruction?

Oh, and we read text. And wrote it too. We used evidence to support our arguments. We examined the perspective of the Spanish and evaluated their reasoning. We debated each other. We spoke and we listened. We talked about it during lunch and recess. We had dreams and nightmares about Atahualpa and Pizarro. And some of us? We even changed our minds. A few times.

But we were also angry. Angry because of what that second group did to the first group's creations. Angry because the beautiful gold artifacts that lined the Inca's temples and gardens were taken. And we were sad... how many people in Peru still speak Ketchua? Why does my family, born in Salvador, speak Spanish?

And at the end of it, when we showcased all the work for our families, I stood in front of this amazing bulletin board of their weavings and took it all in.

And that interviewer's words echoed in my head: ""We've moved away from fluffy projects. They do little to increase student achievement and understanding.""

Fluffy projects!

That interviewer, he's been in the game longer than me. Perhaps he's right. But I wish that I could bring him into the world my students live in.

A world where there is purpose behind the skills we learn, where there is raw emotion and empathy behind a 5-point essay. A world where the art we create links us to history and each other.

My heart is just not in it anymore and I hate to say it but there is the financial part of the job too that makes everything unsatisfactory.

My problem is finding another career path. I have a liberal arts degree and my teaching cert is separate. I feel like going back to school is a waste of my 4-year degree and the 2 years I spent getting my certification. I know I shouldn't feel that any degree is a waste, but I can't help it. I'm not sure if I could even afford to go back to school and I'm worried I'll just get burnt out of that career path as well.

Those who left teaching:

What was the deciding factor in leaving?

What are you doing career-wise now?

Did you need to go back to school in order to make that career change happen?

Update:

I just wanted to thank everyone for the suggestions. I'm really in a rock and a hard place now. I'll definitely be sticking it out until the end of the year, but after that I'm not sure. I need to take time and really ask myself what my plan is. I don't have my Masters. I just started taking classes towards it this school year. 

I really don't have an answer for why I got into teaching/education. I think the interest was always there and I decided to go for it immediately after undergrad. Looking back I wish I had just taken a year off and gave myself more time to think about all my options. I regret not taking that time, but that's in the past. I've honestly been toying with the idea of going back to school for nursing for the last year. I'm just afraid of taking that leap and having it not work out.

I'm frustrated with politics, incompetent admin, teaching to the test, and feeling as though I have little autonomy in anything anymore. All the typical things. I like most of my students, but it often feels as if I'm managing behaviors more than teaching. I know this isn't exclusive just to my school.

I love history, it was my major, and I wanted to be a teacher. I grew up with a teacher mother, surrounded myself with positive teacher role models, I knew this is what I should be doing. As a whole I like it a lot, I struggled some, especially in October, but I found a sort of balance and peace, have two amazing friends that are also new teacher who support me. 

Plus, I was pretty sure my administration team was a dream team. Except for a couple people, everyone is supportive, positive, cheerful, the principal is a rock star with so much to give and learn from. The APs are kind, effective, and there for you. I really feel like I got a sweet gig.

My team though, god my team. My team is made up of me, first year, one 2nd year teacher, one 3rd year teacher who spends all day wishing to be in a high school, and one veteran teacher who has 10 years experience but only 3 in our content. The reason she is in our content is because she was forced out of math to history because the district told the old principle at my school (never met her, was hired by the current one) to get her out of math.

We were basically non-functioning for half a year. I was struggling to teach myself a million things, because no one on my team was helping really - except the coworker who is on his second year but he is honestly still learning too. I was creating lessons the day of because our planning was miserable and not effective. We would meet four times a week and barely be two days ahead. 

It was miserable, and our content specialist, who should be with us for one planning a week and guiding us was no where to be found. Her attention was stretched between 8th grade which is a state testing year, because the team was ALL brand new to the school and two were new teachers, and 6th grade competed with us for her attention because we both had the same planning period. Then if none of that was in the way administration had her in meetings, or she was out for district stuff.

I spent ALL of my first semester begging for more support for my team. Begging for our content leader to be in plannings, going to the principal and telling him issues with the most ""veteran"" member of our team. (A whole rant on its own, but basically has only the obsession to get back into math, in another district, makes casual racists comments in a Title One highly hispanic school on the regular, and is very abrasive and pig headed and refuses to listen). 

I begged someone to come observe me for some feedback, I begged for support with my 'bubble' kids who were on the edge of passing. I think I spent more time after school trying to get advice, trying to get someone to come help our barely floating teams planning, TRYING to get something fixed. Planning only got better only because I took over keeping track of who said what and what were planing to do in a google doc and not letting our 'veteran' teacher control the planning by moving it to my room and pulling up a week and making us pound it out and look for resources. We just now have successful plannings half way through the year and I was the one who had to do it (with help of my two co workers to guide me).

Well today we found out we had the lowest scores in the district on our district monitoring tests we have to give twice a semester. Suddenly we are now being observed once a week, have multiple meetings a month, must have someone in planning with us at all times, must stay after school once a week for 'lesson plan flow training', must have special bubble kid tutoring on another day of the week. Must use specially designed warm ups based off of the tests questions they see that we had access too ALL YEAR apparently along with the packets for the kids but NO ONE EVER TOLD ME ABOUT!! I would have been doing those in a heart beat to save myself time creating warm ups!

I am mad, I am mad, and frustrated. Mad that my kids did so poorly and wondering how I failed them, wondering why this happened. I am mad that my team is barely functioning, and that I had to get us on track when I begged for help. Mad that I have been knocking on peoples doors for months asking for feedback, asking to talk to someone, asking for support with exit tickets and warm ups and my content leader never being around. Mad that our content is poorly supported with little resources and little to guide us so we are digging around on our own with ancient artifacts from the 80s and 90s and the internet as our only resources. 

I will take this as a lesson, I will soak up every minute of those extra meetings and extra plannings. I will needle every person who walks into the room so that I will never be put in the situation of begging for help but being ignored until the numbers come back and suddenly it matters again.

I find myself disillusioned with the admin team I was proud of. I still think they are solid, but they did not listen to me when I pointed out the boiling pot until it boiled over and that frustrates me. I am so very aware now of how little people think of my content, because there is no state test.

Discussion, but also advice would be helpful.  Mostly I'm just kind of frustrated.

Sixth grade Soc Studies teacher here.  At my middle school, we have a student who has been a pain since day one.  He has ADHD accommodations, which we all abide by, and all of us teachers do what we can to help him, but the mother and the student don't reciprocate.  Just to give examples from my perspective, the student does no homework, his classwork is generally halfway complete at best, he doesn't even bother with projects, and doesn't show up for test retakes.  Regarding his behavior, I've had to seat him right next to my desk because he's generally causing problems all around the room that range from teasing and name-calling, to stealing other students' property, and even threatening another student.  The rest of his teachers pretty much have the same issues.  

So today, one of my coworkers approaches me at lunch and says ""guess who made the paper?"" and shows me a newspaper article online with this student and his mother.  The mother is whining and giving this 'poor, pitiful me' routine about how her son's school isn't helping her and giving up on her son, etc.  According to her, the school's only course of action is to just suspend him, give him detentions, and assign failing grades.  The article is pretty much what you would expect.  It's horribly one-sided and over-sensationalizes the idea that all schools are just giving up on students like him.  

The article does make a mention to his suspensions, and provides a link to even view the school documents regarding his suspension, and his accommodations. (Teacher names and all that are blocked out)  In case you're curious, his suspensions are for physical assault on other students, including punching a female student in the face and putting her in a choke-hold.  You can read about it through the link to the documents, but that information is conveniently not put in the article.  Again, its all about how we at the school are not providing her assistance and just further adding to her problem.  There's even a cute video clip that includes footage of the mother helping her son with his homework, even though all of his teachers can attest to the fact that he doesn't even do it.

I know I might be taking it too personally, but I'm pretty frustrated at this.  Many of us go out of our way to help this kid out.  Myself, I give him 3 or even 4 copies of work to make sure he has it and get it turned in, and I go out of my way to find him in the day and give him a pass to come do a test retake, and he's a no show.  He's never been to tutorials either.  And here's his mother, and the article's author, whining about us not providing for and assisting with her son.  She gets upset at the fact her kid was suspended, but what about the girl he assaulted?  Does she not have any rights in this?  And I'm also curious to know that if this is his mother's reaction to all of this, should I ask to have him removed from my class?  Should I even feel the need to seek out my rights of protection, because god forbid I upset the mom, she'll call that reporter again, and I'll be labeled as the big bad wolf that is being mean and unfair to her precious little angel baby.  

This is probably more of a vent, but I'm curious on anyone else's take on this.

Fun fact, this group of sixth graders had not one ""Distinguished"" math score on state tests last year. This makes teaching this group particularly challenging as they are not ready for an accelerated curriculum. 

But back to my friend's situation. Her son typically falls within the lowest 10% of this on-grade-level accelerated class. Well she is upset about his grades. She asked me to be honest and I told her i did not feel he was ready for this particular content and assured her, while abiding by the laws of FERPA, that really none of them are ready. I told her he would be better suited in a gen-ed classroom. 

She went on to say the third 9 weeks is too late in the year to tell her this. Fine. I own that, but I really had not yet been able to accelerate them this year, so I really didn't want to be premature in my opinions. She told me she didn't want to take him out of ""Gifted,"" which he's not in anyway. I wasn't going to argue that one with an upset parent. She followed up by saying he was in gen-ed last year and that he had never excelled as well as he had that year. I wanted to make the obvious argument that excelling in a gen-ed class does not necessarily constitute an accelerated child, but I didn't want to upset her more.

This was recorded by several students and right after this happened a student informed me during class, and I didn't believe him at first. Why? Because our school did not go into any sort of lockdown or informed us of any type of concern during class. So I figured he was kidding or over exaggerating. It wasn't until the kids started checking Snapchat that there was indeed such a fight. 

I found out the girl with the object ran out and ditched the weapon. Still... no lockdown when a student was missing with object she used as a weapon! They found her quickly using our cameras but she ditched the weapon. It still hasn't been found to the best of my knowledge. 

My problem is that I'm getting all my information from students and other teachers. There has been no email or explanation from our administrators or on campus police. This needs to stop! At my school there are multiple safety concerns that just get swept under the rug with no comment. 

Teachers and students have been verbally and physically assaulted at my school without punishment. The atmosphere is that it's ok to get into fights at my school because punishment will be minimal. If a student does something to a teacher, it's handled without care. I've heard of sexual assaults at my school as well and they are swept under the rug and they act they don't happen.

Because our school did not go into any sort of lockdown or informed us of any type of concern during class. So I figured he was kidding or over exaggerating. It wasn't until the kids started checking Snapchat that there was indeed such a fight. 

I found out the girl with the object ran out and ditched the weapon. Still... no lockdown when a student was missing with object she used as a weapon! They found her quickly using our cameras but she ditched the weapon. It still hasn't been found to the best of my knowledge. 

My problem is that I'm getting all my information from students and other teachers. There has been no email or explanation from our administrators or on campus police. This needs to stop! At my school there are multiple safety concerns that just get swept under the rug with no comment. 

Teachers and students have been verbally and physically assaulted at my school without punishment. The atmosphere is that it's ok to get into fights at my school because punishment will be minimal. If a student does something to a teacher, it's handled without care. I've heard of sexual assaults at my school as well and they are swept under the rug and they act they don't happen.

I need help Reddit. I can find the video myself by just looking it up. Only a Spanish tv station got hold of the story.  My school is not safe for my students.

I'm a late 20s white male teaching at an inner city private Christian high school. All of my students are African American or Latino. Gang affiliation has been an issue in the past. We've had fights between students, but that has been rare - most of the students are on the same side. In this case it is the bloods. (For context - we are a small school with only about 40 students, this is only an issue with about half a dozen boys).  

We started back up again this past Wednesday, and I've inadvertently done two things that offended a student's gang sensibilities and made him leave class. The first time was in my world history class. One of our new students made some comment about my desk being messy, and I said, 'yeah, I'm a slob'. A few younger students acted like I'd just insulted their moms. They left class muttering to each other. 

I sensed I'd said a word that was completely normal to me, but meant something different to them. This happens here and there at our school. Sometimes I understand their slang, but other times the joke is on me. My general policy is to move past it; we have a zero tolerance policy for gang language in class and I never know what I'm getting into.

Later, I asked an older student privately what I had said. He told me I can't say that, it disrespects the bloods ('slob'). It's the word backwards I guess, but the 'd' doesn't matter. It's the equivalent of calling a crip a 'crab', the word backwards where, again, the letters 'p' and 'b' are interchangeable. I honestly try to understand where my students are coming from, but this part (like a lot of parts!) just make no sense. IMO, you have to be okay with that. 

The second incident happened today in my government class. I was teaching the students a way to memorize most of the bill of rights using their 10 fingers.

One of the older kids became indignant! He stood up, said 'I need some water'. I was like, 'give me 2 more minutes, we're almost done'. He said 'nope!' and just left.

Our whole school follows this philosophy and charts that track children are not allowed. What do you all think?

""Before I say anything else, I want you to do a little imagining with me. As you read each paragraph, I want you to REALLY work to imagine yourself in this situation, really FEEL what it would be like. I’m sure you will catch on to my metaphor pretty quickly, but stay with me. I really couldn’t think of a better way to illustrate my point:

Imagine that you have a new job. You’re VERY excited about this new job, and a little bit nervous. You know there are parts of it that you will be very good at, but there are some things that you are still working on, or that you might need support from your boss to master. It’s okay, though, because you’re pretty sure that your boss is really nice, and will help you work on those things.

You arrive at work and start meeting your new co-workers, who are just as excited and nervous as you. You notice that some of them seem to be VERY good at nearly everything, and others seem to struggle with even more things than you, but altogether they are a nice enough group and you feel like you will be a good team. You start to make some work friends. It feels good.

Then, at some point – maybe right away, maybe after a few days or weeks or months, your boss sits you ALL down together and explains a new performance management system. On the wall of your communal work area, Boss has posted a list of all the employees, by name. Next to each name is a rainbow of colour-coded cards. Boss explains that every employee will start each day on the same colour, but depending on your performance, your name can be moved up the rainbow, or down the rainbow. People who move up the rainbow will get special extras: a small bonus, or an extra long lunch, or a half-day off. People who move down the rainbow will face consequences: a shorter break, a docked paycheck, a note in their file.

The next day starts out badly before you even get to work. Your alarm doesn’t go off, there’s no hot water left for your shower, you’re out of coffee, your cat has peed on your favourite shoes AND it’s raining. You get to work, and within an hour, your name has been moved down to yellow. You get a warning from your boss. Then, your favourite work friend doesn’t want to work next to you because you just got in trouble and she doesn’t want to get in trouble by association. Your hurt feelings make you distracted, and you make a few careless errors in your tasks. Your name gets moved to orange and now you only get 20 minutes for lunch, which is really upsetting because the sun is finally shining and you had been confident that a nice walk in the fresh air with your buddies would help turn your day around.

On your abbreviated lunch break, you try to get online to order some new shoes. Impatient and frustrated, you curse out loud when the site won’t load properly. In front of everyone, your boss moves your name to red. There goes 50 bucks off your pay. Apparently you won’t be buying new shoes, after all. You approach your boss privately, trying to explain and apologise. Boss tells you, kindly-but-firmly, that “No cussing” is an ironclad rule, and that because everyone heard you cuss, she has to give you the same consequence she would give anyone else. Later, you are short-tempered with a customer, and your name gets moved off the rainbow altogether. A note is placed in your file, documenting a reprimand for inappropriate language in the workplace.

The end of the day approaches. A few of your colleagues get to leave 30 minutes early because their names got moved “up” to blue. This leaves you with extra work that has to be done before you can leave. Among these colleagues, one of them had his name moved up to purple, so he is buying a round of drinks for everyone… Everyone who can leave early, that is. It’s always the same people who can leave early, and really, they’ve become quite clique-y. You convince yourself you wouldn’t really WANT to have drinks with them, anyway. You really fit in better with the red and orange card crowd.
 
How do you feel right now, as an employee? How do you feel about your boss, your colleagues, yourself? How do you feel about having to come back to the same place, the same people, the same chart, tomorrow? What are the chances you will turn things around tomorrow, or ever? What are the chances you will just figure out how to hang at “orange” and deal with the consequences and find ways to enjoy your 20 minute lunch with your orange friends? (I know you are smart enough to stay away from red, but orange is really not so bad, right…?)
If my boss were to hang a chart in the staff lounge, showing which teachers were doing an exceptional job each day, as well as those who were having exceptional-in-a-bad-way days, I would be furious. I would be raging about my privacy, my dignity, my right to be respected by my colleagues for the person I am, and to not be publicly labelled based on any given day. My personal growth is between me and my boss. It has no business being a public display. I don’t know any teacher who would disagree with this. My boss and I have private conversations, plans, and systems to foster my progress.

Parallel to this, I am not opposed to individualized behaviour plans and systems to support individual children. I have used them, and will continue to do so. (I am increasingly opposed to material rewards being part of such systems, but that is another post.) These systems are private. They are discreet. They are between me and that child and his or her parents. These systems are tailored specifically for that child’s needs and quirks and preferences. They allow me a lot of flexibility to accommodate the day that the child only got 5 hours of sleep, or scraped her knee on her way to school. They maintain that child’s dignity and support his or her relationships with peers.

There are many, many reasons not to use publicly-displayed, one-size-fits-all behaviour “systems” in a classroom: they encourage extrinsic rather than intrinsic motivation; they undermine a sense of community; they prevent kids from generalizing good behaviours;  but this is the biggest one, to me:

A child’s dignity, privacy, self-respect are no less real or important or valid, than mine. When I undermine a children’s privacy and dignity, I do damage to their relationships: with their peers, with me, and with themselves.

Yes, behaviour charts can create a classroom full of raised hands, quiet voices, walking feet, please-and-thank-yous.

This post is an honest reflection of my experience, but please note, I have found most of these generalities to be true. Also, it is important to note that I wanted to be a teacher since I was a little girl. I have a true, strong passion for teaching, which I hope puts things into perspective that the 'cons' are not just whining. 

**Background**: I have taught science, English, and I am currently teaching GATE with an emphasis on acceleration in English. I have worked with grades 6-8, and I am endorsed in science, TESOL, GATE, and English. I am almost done with my master's. I am a level II teacher in New Mexico. I will hopefully be a level 3 when I'm done with my master's. I am also a teacher leader in my school. I have had a lot of success, BUT my first year of teaching was literally the WORST year of my life. I would never want to re-live it. I also work in a title 1 school in one of the poorest districts in the country. I have experience with the best and the worst of it all. I'll start with the pros. I have been teaching middle school for 6 years, but I also have 5 years of experience at the college level (adjunct). I have 3 years of tutoring experience at the college level, as well. Oh, yes, the pros...

**Pros**

**The connection with the students:** Again and again, this rings true. If it was not for that connection, I could not stay. The students make it worth it. At the same time, there are students that can really harm your daily work life. I'll talk about that in the cons.

**It's not boring:** I do not really find monotony in my job. I have a lot of control on how interesting I can make it. I'm not sitting at a desk staring at a wall. I'm on my feet, and I enjoy making lessons I'm passionate about.

**Always learning:** Teaching forces you to become a lifelong learner. You can't get stuck (unless you really want to) in one type of mentality. You see so many perspectives, and you can take one subject or topic from many angles.

**It gets better with time**: Teaching seriously gets better with time. That's the hard part. You have to get through those first 3ish years to see its true benefits. This is my 6th year of teaching, and I can say that I have learned how to make my job a thousand times easier. My students are in control of learning. I don't go home exhausted anymore.

**There are jobs:** You really can find a teaching job most places. However, be prepared for the not-so-glamorous jobs when you first start teaching. Also, it just so happens that the worst districts need teachers (obvious, right?). That may seem bad at first glance, but I have found that I have risen to leadership positions in my district because I am not a shitty teacher. I have stuck with it, and I get more respect. 

**A certain level of independence**: Even with all the crazy evaluation systems now, there's no way you can be watched all of the time. In most districts, administrators have to put a certain trust in the fact that you are a professional. Also, I find the more you 'prove' the more you're left alone. I suffered a lot of observations and criticism in order to get to the point where I am. Again, it's the work and effort you put into in the first place. I was rated 'highly effective' (almost exemplary) in my state, so I don't have administrators breathing down my back as much. That took a lot of hard work though.

**An amazing perspective**: Teaching has taught me more about compassion, kindness, patience, love, laughter, etc. than anything ever could. I wish everybody could see through the eyes of a teacher for a day.

**Vacations**: Sure, I do work through some of my vacations, but I am not going to lie, they are amazing. Still, don't become a teacher because you want vacations. The reason why I still have good vacations is that I don't mind prepping for the next session during my breaks. I don't think any teachers truly get full vacations anymore. So, maybe 20 years ago, the vacations were a huge pro, but I think that has changed now that more is expected of teachers. For some perspective, I went to my classroom several times during winter break just to make sure I was ready for the new semester. Also, during the summer, I start really planning a month in advance before the school year starts. That usually takes a lot of hard work. I am also a bit of an “over-achiever” so that might not be what all teachers do. Do not, however, become a teacher because of vacations. It’s not worth it.

**Cons**

There are a lot of problems in modern education, and my post history is littered with those. Despite the benefits listed, the cons seem to outweigh them (in my professional opinion). Teaching is NOT for the light-hearted, and my worst year of my entire life was my first year of teaching. I honestly was suicidal, but there were other things going on in my life at the time. Please feel free to ask me what I did WRONG my first year of teaching. I will gladly share.

**Your hard work (in some ways) does not pay off**: There are no instant results in teaching. And even when you do great, your hard work is rarely noticed. Teaching is not really a respected profession anymore. So be prepared to hear a lot of criticism. I do not know about you all, but criticism is an extremely difficult part of the job. You can spend 15 hours on your lesson plans, only to hear everything you are doing wrong. The first year or so, expect to hear nothing but constant criticism. After that, be lucky if you do not hear anything! I have come to expect that praise is rare, even for the best of teachers. I enjoy not hearing from my administrators anymore. With that being said, the occasional praise from parents, students, and administrators means everything. I keep all the little notes.
 
**You will work more than 40 hours a week**: This is true, especially of newer teachers. Unfortunately, I can’t say the work load lessens as you become more experienced. However, you learn tricks, efficiency, and speed as you get better. 

**Politics**: Our current education system is completely influenced by people who seldom if ever actually visit a classroom. Funding is constantly cut. People have completely incorrect and misleading views about education. This is my personal opinion, but education is slowly being destroyed in the United States. They are moving toward privatization of education, and I believe within 20 years public education will be gone. You can think this is a good thing, but I do not believe public institutions should be corporatized. In fact, this corporatization has increased ridiculous testing, standards, and budget cuts. Don’t go into teaching thinking there are people in it for the best interest of children. I honestly believe that’s naïve. I don’t even know if all teachers are in it for the best interest of children.

**It’s a business**: Education has become a business. ‘They’ are using business models and expecting them to work in schools. They don’t. What happens with these business models is you get a high teacher turnover, ridiculous competition and standards, and students treated as numbers instead of people. In essence, it’s the “McDonaldiization of Education.""

**It’s the parents – Let me explain**: Now, don’t bash me here. I love all of my students, even the most hard to handle. However, there are a lot of issues with this generation. I’m not really hear to debate ‘but all generations suck’. Yeah, maybe just people suck. However, here are some issues, and they are all one way or another a result of bad parenting.

*There is either extreme helicopter parenting or extreme lack of parenting. There doesn’t always seem to be a balance.

*Students want to be entertained constantly.

*Parents are always right, just like the customer is always right. 

*This is definitely a ‘nobody fails’ and ‘everybody is special’ generation. It is really hard to fail students, and you have to be constantly careful of what you say/do. Anything can and will be used against you.

*Students are disrespectful to you because they are disrespectful at home.

*Students have problems in the classroom because they have problems at home.

Any issue you have with a student is almost always based on something as a result of home life. Knowing that, I have more compassion for my students before I get angry. 

**The pay**: MOST Teachers do not get paid enough for what they do. I’m not arguing this with anybody to be honest. If you want to argue, let me show you the bill for how much I pay for my own school supplies. Let me calculate the number of extra hours I work a week for nothing. Let me talk about the nights I cried when I first started teaching. Teachers should absolutely be paid more, even a little bit more!

**Unrealistic expectations**: Teachers, students, and administrators are constantly fighting unrealistic expectations. Even when you do make growth and gains with students, it usually isn’t good enough. It’s always, more, more, more. Remember, it’s a business now.

**Why am I still doing it?**

Despite the negative stuff, I have found a balance in my life and my teaching career. I have learned to ‘fight the system’ in my own classroom. I can’t control the politics. I can’t control the administration. I can’t even technically control my students (but I have learned to ‘trick them’ into learning), but I can control how I teach in my own classroom. Here are a few things that have helped me:

*I have amazing classroom management. I am willing to give any advice to any teacher on how to change the way your classroom functions. I work with some really rough students, by the way. 

*I don’t care what other teachers think of me. Teachers put each other down, and you better believe they don’t like when you’re successful. I have learned to do what I think is right, even if other teachers criticize. I can provide examples.

*I have stuck it out. I got through the pain so that I can learn from my mistakes. I also have gotten raises by fulfilling state requirements and doing really hard work.

*I am me. With pinterest and thousands of articles out there on how to be a good teacher, my best advice is to be YOU. I am a little sarcastic. I’m 5’2”, short, and bubbly. I probably look like a student. I am a girly girl. I think I have a slight lisp. My students LOVE me for who I am. I’m not going to change because pininterest told me, too. I am often shocked that students love me just as I am. They also appreciate teachers who can laugh at themselves.

*Speaking of pininterest, do not do something because it ‘looks good’. DO something because it has real research behind it.

*I don’t buy into the negativity. Teachers do complain about everything. Honestly, I can’t do it anymore. If things get that bad that I need to constantly complain, I’m changing careers.

*I don’t get lazy. This may sound rude, but a lot of teachers get lazy. It can be easy to sit at that desk and od the same old lessons. There is burnout, and I have been there. You have to find ways to overcome it. 

*I expect imperfection. I worked with a teacher who would stay 5 hours after to work to reword test questions. The students KNOW you’re human. You’re going to make mistakes. Most of the time, I’m honest with my students. “Sorry I didn’t staple these papers; I was feeling really tired. Could you guys staple them as you pick them up?” or ""Oh, did I really write that? How embarrassing!""

*I admit when I’m wrong. Nobody likes a know it all. My students have proved me wrong on many occasions. I allow RESPECTFUL debate and negotiations in my classroom. 

*I avoid work friendships. This may sound rude (again), but it just TOO much drama. I honestly leave my personal life at home. I have acquaintances, but I have made mistakes becoming too close to teachers. Teachers are often worse than students. 

*I have a life outside of teaching. I love running, photography, staying active, keeping strong in my faith, traveling, eating out, hiking, biking, learning languages, etc. I am not STOPPING my life for my job. However, I do know that I have to sacrifice some time for some sanity in my job. I go in every Sunday. It’s a sacrifice I make so that I can enjoy my week.

*I work my ass off. I put all the effort in outside of school so that my class runs smoothly when I am in school.

I hope this helped some of you get a better perspective on teaching. There are more pros/cons that can be listed, and I will add anything that you think should be added! I really am here to give you an honest perspective, and I'm also willing to give any advice.

Thanks for reading!

This post is an honest reflection of my experience, but please note, I have found most of these generalities to be true. Also, it is important to note that I wanted to be a teacher since I was a little girl. I have a true, strong passion for teaching, which I hope puts things into perspective that the 'cons' are not just whining. 

**Background**: I have taught science, English, and I am currently teaching GATE with an emphasis on acceleration in English. I have worked with grades 6-8, and I am endorsed in science, TESOL, GATE, and English. I am almost done with my master's. I am a level II teacher in New Mexico. I will hopefully be a level 3 when I'm done with my master's. I am also a teacher leader in my school. I have had a lot of success, BUT my first year of teaching was literally the WORST year of my life. I would never want to re-live it. I also work in a title 1 school in one of the poorest districts in the country. I have experience with the best and the worst of it all. I'll start with the pros. I have been teaching middle school for 6 years, but I also have 5 years of experience at the college level (adjunct). I have 3 years of tutoring experience at the college level, as well. Oh, yes, the pros...

**Pros**

**The connection with the students:** Again and again, this rings true. If it was not for that connection, I could not stay. The students make it worth it. At the same time, there are students that can really harm your daily work life. I'll talk about that in the cons.

**It's not boring:** I do not really find monotony in my job. I have a lot of control on how interesting I can make it. I'm not sitting at a desk staring at a wall. I'm on my feet, and I enjoy making lessons I'm passionate about.

**Always learning:** Teaching forces you to become a lifelong learner. You can't get stuck (unless you really want to) in one type of mentality. You see so many perspectives, and you can take one subject or topic from many angles.

**It gets better with time**: Teaching seriously gets better with time. That's the hard part. You have to get through those first 3ish years to see its true benefits. This is my 6th year of teaching, and I can say that I have learned how to make my job a thousand times easier. My students are in control of learning. I don't go home exhausted anymore.

**There are jobs:** You really can find a teaching job most places. However, be prepared for the not-so-glamorous jobs when you first start teaching. Also, it just so happens that the worst districts need teachers (obvious, right?). That may seem bad at first glance, but I have found that I have risen to leadership positions in my district because I am not a shitty teacher. I have stuck with it, and I get more respect. 

**A certain level of independence**: Even with all the crazy evaluation systems now, there's no way you can be watched all of the time. In most districts, administrators have to put a certain trust in the fact that you are a professional. Also, I find the more you 'prove' the more you're left alone. I suffered a lot of observations and criticism in order to get to the point where I am. Again, it's the work and effort you put into in the first place. I was rated 'highly effective' (almost exemplary) in my state, so I don't have administrators breathing down my back as much. That took a lot of hard work though.

**An amazing perspective**: Teaching has taught me more about compassion, kindness, patience, love, laughter, etc. than anything ever could. I wish everybody could see through the eyes of a teacher for a day.

**Vacations**: Sure, I do work through some of my vacations, but I am not going to lie, they are amazing. Still, don't become a teacher because you want vacations. The reason why I still have good vacations is that I don't mind prepping for the next session during my breaks. I don't think any teachers truly get full vacations anymore. So, maybe 20 years ago, the vacations were a huge pro, but I think that has changed now that more is expected of teachers. For some perspective, I went to my classroom several times during winter break just to make sure I was ready for the new semester. Also, during the summer, I start really planning a month in advance before the school year starts. That usually takes a lot of hard work. I am also a bit of an “over-achiever” so that might not be what all teachers do. Do not, however, become a teacher because of vacations. It’s not worth it.

**Cons**

There are a lot of problems in modern education, and my post history is littered with those. Despite the benefits listed, the cons seem to outweigh them (in my professional opinion). Teaching is NOT for the light-hearted, and my worst year of my entire life was my first year of teaching. I honestly was suicidal, but there were other things going on in my life at the time. Please feel free to ask me what I did WRONG my first year of teaching. I will gladly share.

**Your hard work (in some ways) does not pay off**: There are no instant results in teaching. And even when you do great, your hard work is rarely noticed. Teaching is not really a respected profession anymore. So be prepared to hear a lot of criticism. I do not know about you all, but criticism is an extremely difficult part of the job. You can spend 15 hours on your lesson plans, only to hear everything you are doing wrong. The first year or so, expect to hear nothing but constant criticism. After that, be lucky if you do not hear anything! I have come to expect that praise is rare, even for the best of teachers. I enjoy not hearing from my administrators anymore. With that being said, the occasional praise from parents, students, and administrators means everything. I keep all the little notes.
 
**You will work more than 40 hours a week**: This is true, especially of newer teachers. Unfortunately, I can’t say the work load lessens as you become more experienced. However, you learn tricks, efficiency, and speed as you get better. 

**Politics**: Our current education system is completely influenced by people who seldom if ever actually visit a classroom. Funding is constantly cut. People have completely incorrect and misleading views about education. This is my personal opinion, but education is slowly being destroyed in the United States. They are moving toward privatization of education, and I believe within 20 years public education will be gone. You can think this is a good thing, but I do not believe public institutions should be corporatized. In fact, this corporatization has increased ridiculous testing, standards, and budget cuts. Don’t go into teaching thinking there are people in it for the best interest of children. I honestly believe that’s naïve. I don’t even know if all teachers are in it for the best interest of children.

**It’s a business**: Education has become a business. ‘They’ are using business models and expecting them to work in schools. They don’t. What happens with these business models is you get a high teacher turnover, ridiculous competition and standards, and students treated as numbers instead of people. In essence, it’s the “McDonaldiization of Education.""

**It’s the parents – Let me explain**: Now, don’t bash me here. I love all of my students, even the most hard to handle. However, there are a lot of issues with this generation. I’m not really hear to debate ‘but all generations suck’. Yeah, maybe just people suck. However, here are some issues, and they are all one way or another a result of bad parenting.

*There is either extreme helicopter parenting or extreme lack of parenting. There doesn’t always seem to be a balance.

*Students want to be entertained constantly.

*Parents are always right, just like the customer is always right. 

*This is definitely a ‘nobody fails’ and ‘everybody is special’ generation. It is really hard to fail students, and you have to be constantly careful of what you say/do. Anything can and will be used against you.

*Students have problems in the classroom because they have problems at home.

If you want to argue, let me show you the bill for how much I pay for my own school supplies. Let me calculate the number of extra hours I work a week for nothing.

I dread each day and when I´m in class I feel this sense of dread and agony. 

A bit about my situation:

I´m a 24 year old American working as a language assistant in Spain. It´s a program through the Spanish government where you work for 12 classroom hours a week and get paid a monthly grant for basic living needs. I also have a 2nd job teaching Facebook engineers English over Skype through an American company which is great for a bit of spending money but also helping me burn out faster, but I´ll stick to talking about this actual classroom job for now. 

The classroom job is only two days a week, 7 hours per day, which doesn´t seem like a lot at all, but after 3 years of doing this, I feel like I cannot possibly continue. I only work 2 days a week because my school was nice and adapted my schedule to the long commute. I commute 4 hours a day (2 there, 2 back). 

The biggest problem with this job is that none of the schools or teachers actually follow  the contract. I´m supposed to just be a language assistant, but they treat me as if I were their slave, or a very cheap extra teacher to boss around. According to my contract, I´m legally not allowed to ever be alone with the kids, I´m not allowed to grade exams, I´m not supposed to have to plan all of the lessons... basically I´m meant to be utilized in the classroom as an assistant or a tool to provide English conversation with the kids. In other words, there should ALWAYS be the main teacher teaching in the classroom while I assist her. I do not have any teacher training. I majored in Spanish at university.

In my 3 years of doing this job I´ve had to grade exams, create exams, teach in classrooms of 25 kids completely on my own, plan daily lessons, come up with activities on the spot, etc. 
I changed to a new school this year and I only work with one teacher and it´s just... pushed me over the edge. I spend 7 hours a day taking orders from this woman while she basically spends those days taking a break. 

For example here´s how my day has gone so far:
First class was the kindergarteners. Main teacher drew ballpoint pen halloween pumpkins in their notebook and told them to  color it while I was meant to walk around and teach them the colors in English, teach them how to say different words, etc. So the main English teacher who is paid almost 4 times as much as me improvised a poorly drawn pumpkin in January and expected me to improvise a lesson out of that (to 5 year olds who don´t speak a word of English, no less). 

2nd class was with 1st graders. There´s a flu going around so only 5 kids showed up. Main teacher asked me to think of a fun game to play with them. Main teacher sat in the back of the class to grade papers while I was left in charge of the whole class with no lesson plans.

3rd class was with 3rd graders. The main teacher did activities from the workbook with the class while she sent me to the back to work with 2 students at a time (I had printed out some worksheets in preperation because she does this often). She told me I could only spend 15  minutes with each group because she wanted me to work with more students. I had to improvise a way to drastically shorten the activity.

etc, etc.

It´s like this every day. She is lazy and unprepared and expects me to come in and have amazing lessons with a ton of energy. I´m sick of it. The kids don´t speak a word of English and it´s just painful and exhausting. 

This is all AFTER I stuck up for myself and demanded they not take advantage of me so much. Before it was much worse. Before they wanted me to have a ¨story time¨ in the library every day during the break with the ¨punished students¨ where they basically  dump 20 5-10 year olds on me and leave me alone. The main teacher wanted me to work with the entire class on my own while she colored with a few in the back. So I´ve already stuck up for myself quite a bit. The problem is that it´s such a crappy program with nobody enforcing the rules, nobody in charge that cares, and the knowledge that if I quit, there are hundreds of Americans ready to take my spot.

I feel so burnt out. I have 4 months left of this school year to get through. Is this what teaching with your own classroom is like? Am I so burnt out because this is a crappy situation or because I´m not meant to be a teacher?

I think something that adds to it is the absolute disorder and chaos and low quality of the classroom. It´s obvious that the main teacher never ever plans any kind of lesson. There´s no order to anything. She randomly decides to draw a face in each student´s notebook for them to color. That´s the day´s lesson. Or she yells vocabulary words at them with no rhyme or reason. It´s chaotic and nobody learns anything ever. There´s constant shouting, no actual teaching ever (other than telling them to work in their workbooks), and it feels really.... empty.

So I am a first year teacher and I have lost control of my one middle school class. I travel there from the High School where I normally teach, to teach the last period of the day (8th). The class itself is 32 students. They simply talk non stop and it is a constant struggle to have them settled down and quiet going through a lesson. I have 3-4 students who non stop try to get up, walk around, and just talk outloud excessively. I have called home numerous times for them and written them up.

One of the main issues however, is that administration does not want to deal with the students that I do write up. They have enough on their plates and do not want me writing referalls for each incident of these students. Calling home has done nothing to help aid the situation either (in fact it has worsened some students behavior).

The general procedures I outlined in the beginning of the year included coming to class, quietly working on the Do Now when they entered, raising their hands if they need to use the bathroom, and being generally respectful of one another (not talking when someone else is talking, etc). I do my best to make lessons interesting/do labs, but even when we do labs they are constantly off task and screaming/not completing the lab.

My current class disciplinary procedures are 
1) Name on the board.
2) Verbal Warning.
3) Call home.
4) Referral + Call Home
5) Referral, Detention, Call home.

Sadly, I can not actually give detention as only the administration can (and as I previously mentioned they do not want to be bothered quite honestly). 

Since it is a new year and we have had a week long break, I am hoping they will come back more reasonable/willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice of things I should try? I am at my wits end as the class is really a burden on my soul, and I dread entering it everyday. My high school classes on the other hand are a total joy.

  She also shows us news, and pauses it every time a controversial topic comes up.

I feel like it is rarely said but I really mean it. A couple of days ago, a teacher from our school named Mrs. Eddy passed away due to cancer. We had all known about it. Hell, when I had her for Honors English 11, she would sometimes have to miss class for chemotherapy sessions. At the beginning of the school year, she took an extended leave which turned out to be indefinite. 

The reason I say this is because Mrs. Eddy was one of the few teachers I actually gave a shit about. She was the first person to EVER care about my writing and inspired me to read and write like no other teacher did. I got back into poetry and screenplay writing because of her. 

I am not going to say that she changed my life or that she was that one teacher that inspired me to be great. That shit is for the movies. However, she was a great teacher, a wonderful person, and a kind soul.

It saddens me to think about the fact that I never got to tell her that. 

So for all the teachers out there who wake up every morning, and inspire, thank you. I know it's not easy. Teaching isn't an easy job. I couldn't do it, especially if I had cancer. 

Mrs. Eddy, my thoughts are with you tonight.

And to all other teachers, thank you for everything you do.

At the beginning of each block I like to talk to my students. I don’t give them any directions; I don’t tell them anything important. We just talk.

I siege them with questions. I hurl shot after shot into the room and latch onto what they throw back. Early in the year I’m satisfied with a couple of timid answers. After a brief statement about a birthday party or a complaint about work, I downshift and the class lurches into English mode. 

Eventually they talk back. 

**Talking Back**

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate. They no longer wait for my questions, but instead go on the offensive. Sometimes I’m flattered (when students want to know how I met my smoking hot wife). Other times I’m agitated (when students resolutely defended the stance that advertising had no effect on their lives.) Mostly, though, I enjoy a casual camaraderie with my class as I share interesting things I either know about (like the inevitable [house centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata)), or things I’ve been thinking about (anything from the value of dogs to [why female students have better handwriting than male](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2xwhhj/why_do_girls_tend_to_have_better_handwriting_than/)). They piggyback off my stories and share experiences of their own; they piggyback off my ideas and share ideas of their own.

As the year goes on, I inevitably see students grin widely. They ask questions about things that they suspect I might want to speak at-length about. *He’s doing it again*, they think as they ask about my projects, my travel, my outfit. *We waste so much time in this class.*

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

If tasked to defend this getting-to-know-you time, say, in front of an administrator, I might speak at some length about the conversational skills it builds. Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers. I could argue that I am modelling good conversation skills and hitting speaking and listening standards in the process.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own.

The teacher asked me back today and as I would going through her sub notes and lesson I found seven hand written apologies of varying detail made out to me. Here are some lines from what they wrote. 

""I will not treat you like that again."" 
""Please accept my apology""
""I am sorry for laughing and not doing what I was supposed to do""
""I know that you are an AMAZING sub (students caps not mine) I wanted to let you know I was being disrespectful""
""I will do my best to make sure it does not happen again""

The question was: ""What is a project that you've seen from students in the last month that amazed you?""

Some sample responses I got were:
""Hm. Interesting question. I think it's reading. Yeah, reading has been the project that has amazed me the most.""

""We track our students' reading levels on a big bulletin board outside. What's amazing has been watching their growth.""

""Well, we've moved away from fluffy projects. They do little to increase student achievement and understanding. We're more interested in cultivating students that can analyze and write about text.""

This year, my team taught our third graders about the encounter between the Spanish and the Inca.

We taught the students how to weave like the Inca. They spent hours on their craft during their free time, going over and under, over and under. They thought about what colors would go well together and complimented each other on their beautiful pieces. We created gold artifacts, like the Inca made for their temples. And we asked ourselves, does gold still have value if it isn't used for money?

We divided the class into two made up cultures, Hokies and Heelots, each with their own made-up customs and ways of interacting that purposefully contradicted the other (one culture makes eye contact, the other does not, etc), and we had them interact to experience cultural disconnect and reflect on it.

Half the class created art out of random twigs, stones, and leaves we found on the playground, and then the other half of the class came and created their own art, not realizing they had destroyed the other half's creations. And we asked, who owns nature? Is it okay for new cultures to change another culture's art? Is it destruction?

Oh, and we read text. And wrote it too. We used evidence to support our arguments. We examined the perspective of the Spanish and evaluated their reasoning. We debated each other. We spoke and we listened. We talked about it during lunch and recess. We had dreams and nightmares about Atahualpa and Pizarro. And some of us? We even changed our minds. A few times.

But we were also angry. Angry because of what that second group did to the first group's creations. Angry because the beautiful gold artifacts that lined the Inca's temples and gardens were taken. And we were sad... how many people in Peru still speak Ketchua? Why does my family, born in Salvador, speak Spanish?

And at the end of it, when we showcased all the work for our families, I stood in front of this amazing bulletin board of their weavings and took it all in.

And that interviewer's words echoed in my head: ""We've moved away from fluffy projects. They do little to increase student achievement and understanding.""

Fluffy projects!

That interviewer, he's been in the game longer than me. Perhaps he's right. But I wish that I could bring him into the world my students live in.

A world where there is purpose behind the skills we learn, where there is raw emotion and empathy behind a 5-point essay. A world where the art we create links us to history and each other.

I love history, it was my major, and I wanted to be a teacher. I grew up with a teacher mother, surrounded myself with positive teacher role models, I knew this is what I should be doing. As a whole I like it a lot, I struggled some, especially in October, but I found a sort of balance and peace, have two amazing friends that are also new teacher who support me. 

Plus, I was pretty sure my administration team was a dream team. Except for a couple people, everyone is supportive, positive, cheerful, the principal is a rock star with so much to give and learn from. The APs are kind, effective, and there for you. I really feel like I got a sweet gig.

My team though, god my team. My team is made up of me, first year, one 2nd year teacher, one 3rd year teacher who spends all day wishing to be in a high school, and one veteran teacher who has 10 years experience but only 3 in our content. The reason she is in our content is because she was forced out of math to history because the district told the old principle at my school (never met her, was hired by the current one) to get her out of math.

We were basically non-functioning for half a year. I was struggling to teach myself a million things, because no one on my team was helping really - except the coworker who is on his second year but he is honestly still learning too. I was creating lessons the day of because our planning was miserable and not effective. We would meet four times a week and barely be two days ahead. 

It was miserable, and our content specialist, who should be with us for one planning a week and guiding us was no where to be found. Her attention was stretched between 8th grade which is a state testing year, because the team was ALL brand new to the school and two were new teachers, and 6th grade competed with us for her attention because we both had the same planning period. Then if none of that was in the way administration had her in meetings, or she was out for district stuff.

I spent ALL of my first semester begging for more support for my team. Begging for our content leader to be in plannings, going to the principal and telling him issues with the most ""veteran"" member of our team. (A whole rant on its own, but basically has only the obsession to get back into math, in another district, makes casual racists comments in a Title One highly hispanic school on the regular, and is very abrasive and pig headed and refuses to listen). 

I begged someone to come observe me for some feedback, I begged for support with my 'bubble' kids who were on the edge of passing. I think I spent more time after school trying to get advice, trying to get someone to come help our barely floating teams planning, TRYING to get something fixed. Planning only got better only because I took over keeping track of who said what and what were planing to do in a google doc and not letting our 'veteran' teacher control the planning by moving it to my room and pulling up a week and making us pound it out and look for resources. We just now have successful plannings half way through the year and I was the one who had to do it (with help of my two co workers to guide me).

Well today we found out we had the lowest scores in the district on our district monitoring tests we have to give twice a semester. Suddenly we are now being observed once a week, have multiple meetings a month, must have someone in planning with us at all times, must stay after school once a week for 'lesson plan flow training', must have special bubble kid tutoring on another day of the week. Must use specially designed warm ups based off of the tests questions they see that we had access too ALL YEAR apparently along with the packets for the kids but NO ONE EVER TOLD ME ABOUT!! I would have been doing those in a heart beat to save myself time creating warm ups!

I am mad, I am mad, and frustrated. Mad that my kids did so poorly and wondering how I failed them, wondering why this happened. I am mad that my team is barely functioning, and that I had to get us on track when I begged for help. Mad that I have been knocking on peoples doors for months asking for feedback, asking to talk to someone, asking for support with exit tickets and warm ups and my content leader never being around. Mad that our content is poorly supported with little resources and little to guide us so we are digging around on our own with ancient artifacts from the 80s and 90s and the internet as our only resources. 

I will take this as a lesson, I will soak up every minute of those extra meetings and extra plannings. I will needle every person who walks into the room so that I will never be put in the situation of begging for help but being ignored until the numbers come back and suddenly it matters again.

I find myself disillusioned with the admin team I was proud of. I still think they are solid, but they did not listen to me when I pointed out the boiling pot until it boiled over and that frustrates me.

Discussion, but also advice would be helpful.  Mostly I'm just kind of frustrated.

Sixth grade Soc Studies teacher here.  At my middle school, we have a student who has been a pain since day one.  He has ADHD accommodations, which we all abide by, and all of us teachers do what we can to help him, but the mother and the student don't reciprocate.  Just to give examples from my perspective, the student does no homework, his classwork is generally halfway complete at best, he doesn't even bother with projects, and doesn't show up for test retakes.  Regarding his behavior, I've had to seat him right next to my desk because he's generally causing problems all around the room that range from teasing and name-calling, to stealing other students' property, and even threatening another student.  The rest of his teachers pretty much have the same issues.  

So today, one of my coworkers approaches me at lunch and says ""guess who made the paper?"" and shows me a newspaper article online with this student and his mother.  The mother is whining and giving this 'poor, pitiful me' routine about how her son's school isn't helping her and giving up on her son, etc.  According to her, the school's only course of action is to just suspend him, give him detentions, and assign failing grades.  The article is pretty much what you would expect.  It's horribly one-sided and over-sensationalizes the idea that all schools are just giving up on students like him.  

The article does make a mention to his suspensions, and provides a link to even view the school documents regarding his suspension, and his accommodations. (Teacher names and all that are blocked out)  In case you're curious, his suspensions are for physical assault on other students, including punching a female student in the face and putting her in a choke-hold.  You can read about it through the link to the documents, but that information is conveniently not put in the article.  Again, its all about how we at the school are not providing her assistance and just further adding to her problem.  There's even a cute video clip that includes footage of the mother helping her son with his homework, even though all of his teachers can attest to the fact that he doesn't even do it.

I know I might be taking it too personally, but I'm pretty frustrated at this.  Many of us go out of our way to help this kid out.  Myself, I give him 3 or even 4 copies of work to make sure he has it and get it turned in, and I go out of my way to find him in the day and give him a pass to come do a test retake, and he's a no show.  He's never been to tutorials either.  And here's his mother, and the article's author, whining about us not providing for and assisting with her son.  She gets upset at the fact her kid was suspended, but what about the girl he assaulted?  Does she not have any rights in this?  And I'm also curious to know that if this is his mother's reaction to all of this, should I ask to have him removed from my class?  Should I even feel the need to seek out my rights of protection, because god forbid I upset the mom, she'll call that reporter again, and I'll be labeled as the big bad wolf that is being mean and unfair to her precious little angel baby.  

This is probably more of a vent, but I'm curious on anyone else's take on this.

Sixth grade Soc Studies teacher here.  At my middle school, we have a student who has been a pain since day one.  He has ADHD accommodations, which we all abide by, and all of us teachers do what we can to help him, but the mother and the student don't reciprocate.

It doesn't matter what you tell her to do, even the simplest of directions is a reason for her to argue with you.

This is the first time since last Friday that we've had reading class). At that point it had been a full day of her saying shit like this to me every time I speak, so I said to her ""it would be nice if you could speak to me just once without being disrespectful."" I didn't raise my voice, I just said it very matter-of-fact.

She immediately blew up. Started saying how all the teachers always pick on her, and then she said ""I don't know why you're even a teacher if you're gonna get offended by a simple question! God, you're so annoying.""

She tells me to keep in contact with her whenever there's a particularly difficult day with her daughter, and I always do.

This was recorded by several students and right after this happened a student informed me during class, and I didn't believe him at first. Why? Because our school did not go into any sort of lockdown or informed us of any type of concern during class. So I figured he was kidding or over exaggerating. It wasn't until the kids started checking Snapchat that there was indeed such a fight. 

I found out the girl with the object ran out and ditched the weapon. Still... no lockdown when a student was missing with object she used as a weapon! They found her quickly using our cameras but she ditched the weapon. It still hasn't been found to the best of my knowledge. 

My problem is that I'm getting all my information from students and other teachers. There has been no email or explanation from our administrators or on campus police. This needs to stop! At my school there are multiple safety concerns that just get swept under the rug with no comment. 

Teachers and students have been verbally and physically assaulted at my school without punishment. The atmosphere is that it's ok to get into fights at my school because punishment will be minimal. If a student does something to a teacher, it's handled without care. I've heard of sexual assaults at my school as well and they are swept under the rug and they act they don't happen.

I need help Reddit. I can find the video myself by just looking it up. Only a Spanish tv station got hold of the story.  My school is not safe for my students.

I'm tired of this and I need help!So on Wednesday two girls got into a fight in the gym and one pulled out a box cutter (or sharp object) and cut the other student multiple times. 

This was recorded by several students and right after this happened a student informed me during class, and I didn't believe him at first. Why? Because our school did not go into any sort of lockdown or informed us of any type of concern during class. So I figured he was kidding or over exaggerating. It wasn't until the kids started checking Snapchat that there was indeed such a fight. 

I found out the girl with the object ran out and ditched the weapon. Still... no lockdown when a student was missing with object she used as a weapon! They found her quickly using our cameras but she ditched the weapon. It still hasn't been found to the best of my knowledge.

I'm a late 20s white male teaching at an inner city private Christian high school. All of my students are African American or Latino. Gang affiliation has been an issue in the past. We've had fights between students, but that has been rare - most of the students are on the same side. In this case it is the bloods. (For context - we are a small school with only about 40 students, this is only an issue with about half a dozen boys).  

We started back up again this past Wednesday, and I've inadvertently done two things that offended a student's gang sensibilities and made him leave class. The first time was in my world history class. One of our new students made some comment about my desk being messy, and I said, 'yeah, I'm a slob'. A few younger students acted like I'd just insulted their moms. They left class muttering to each other. 

I sensed I'd said a word that was completely normal to me, but meant something different to them. This happens here and there at our school. Sometimes I understand their slang, but other times the joke is on me. My general policy is to move past it; we have a zero tolerance policy for gang language in class and I never know what I'm getting into.

Later, I asked an older student privately what I had said. He told me I can't say that, it disrespects the bloods ('slob'). It's the word backwards I guess, but the 'd' doesn't matter. It's the equivalent of calling a crip a 'crab', the word backwards where, again, the letters 'p' and 'b' are interchangeable. I honestly try to understand where my students are coming from, but this part (like a lot of parts!) just make no sense. IMO, you have to be okay with that. 

The second incident happened today in my government class. I was teaching the students a way to memorize most of the bill of rights using their 10 fingers. The fourth amendment has you hold up four fingers and then make a fist and knock on a desk or the wall, like the cops knocking on your door will need a warrant to come in (search and seizure). One of the older kids became indignant! He stood up, said 'I need some water'. I was like, 'give me 2 more minutes, we're almost done'. He said 'nope!' and just left. I'm still not sure what was offensive about this one.

Anyway i just thought I'd share. I read this sub all the time, you are all a big source of inspiration for me. I'd love to know if anyone else has experienced this, has any info that could be helpful, or has any advice to handle these situations in the future.

Our whole school follows this philosophy and charts that track children are not allowed. What do you all think?

""Before I say anything else, I want you to do a little imagining with me. As you read each paragraph, I want you to REALLY work to imagine yourself in this situation, really FEEL what it would be like. I’m sure you will catch on to my metaphor pretty quickly, but stay with me. I really couldn’t think of a better way to illustrate my point:

Imagine that you have a new job. You’re VERY excited about this new job, and a little bit nervous. You know there are parts of it that you will be very good at, but there are some things that you are still working on, or that you might need support from your boss to master. It’s okay, though, because you’re pretty sure that your boss is really nice, and will help you work on those things.

You arrive at work and start meeting your new co-workers, who are just as excited and nervous as you. You notice that some of them seem to be VERY good at nearly everything, and others seem to struggle with even more things than you, but altogether they are a nice enough group and you feel like you will be a good team. You start to make some work friends. It feels good.

Then, at some point – maybe right away, maybe after a few days or weeks or months, your boss sits you ALL down together and explains a new performance management system. On the wall of your communal work area, Boss has posted a list of all the employees, by name. Next to each name is a rainbow of colour-coded cards. Boss explains that every employee will start each day on the same colour, but depending on your performance, your name can be moved up the rainbow, or down the rainbow. People who move up the rainbow will get special extras: a small bonus, or an extra long lunch, or a half-day off. People who move down the rainbow will face consequences: a shorter break, a docked paycheck, a note in their file.

The next day starts out badly before you even get to work. Your alarm doesn’t go off, there’s no hot water left for your shower, you’re out of coffee, your cat has peed on your favourite shoes AND it’s raining. You get to work, and within an hour, your name has been moved down to yellow. You get a warning from your boss. Then, your favourite work friend doesn’t want to work next to you because you just got in trouble and she doesn’t want to get in trouble by association. Your hurt feelings make you distracted, and you make a few careless errors in your tasks. Your name gets moved to orange and now you only get 20 minutes for lunch, which is really upsetting because the sun is finally shining and you had been confident that a nice walk in the fresh air with your buddies would help turn your day around.

On your abbreviated lunch break, you try to get online to order some new shoes. Impatient and frustrated, you curse out loud when the site won’t load properly. In front of everyone, your boss moves your name to red. There goes 50 bucks off your pay. Apparently you won’t be buying new shoes, after all. You approach your boss privately, trying to explain and apologise. Boss tells you, kindly-but-firmly, that “No cussing” is an ironclad rule, and that because everyone heard you cuss, she has to give you the same consequence she would give anyone else. Later, you are short-tempered with a customer, and your name gets moved off the rainbow altogether. A note is placed in your file, documenting a reprimand for inappropriate language in the workplace.

The end of the day approaches. A few of your colleagues get to leave 30 minutes early because their names got moved “up” to blue. This leaves you with extra work that has to be done before you can leave. Among these colleagues, one of them had his name moved up to purple, so he is buying a round of drinks for everyone… Everyone who can leave early, that is. It’s always the same people who can leave early, and really, they’ve become quite clique-y. You convince yourself you wouldn’t really WANT to have drinks with them, anyway. You really fit in better with the red and orange card crowd.
 
How do you feel right now, as an employee? How do you feel about your boss, your colleagues, yourself? How do you feel about having to come back to the same place, the same people, the same chart, tomorrow? What are the chances you will turn things around tomorrow, or ever? What are the chances you will just figure out how to hang at “orange” and deal with the consequences and find ways to enjoy your 20 minute lunch with your orange friends? (I know you are smart enough to stay away from red, but orange is really not so bad, right…?)
If my boss were to hang a chart in the staff lounge, showing which teachers were doing an exceptional job each day, as well as those who were having exceptional-in-a-bad-way days, I would be furious. I would be raging about my privacy, my dignity, my right to be respected by my colleagues for the person I am, and to not be publicly labelled based on any given day. My personal growth is between me and my boss. It has no business being a public display. I don’t know any teacher who would disagree with this. My boss and I have private conversations, plans, and systems to foster my progress.

Parallel to this, I am not opposed to individualized behaviour plans and systems to support individual children. I have used them, and will continue to do so. (I am increasingly opposed to material rewards being part of such systems, but that is another post.) These systems are private. They are discreet. They are between me and that child and his or her parents. These systems are tailored specifically for that child’s needs and quirks and preferences. They allow me a lot of flexibility to accommodate the day that the child only got 5 hours of sleep, or scraped her knee on her way to school. They maintain that child’s dignity and support his or her relationships with peers.

There are many, many reasons not to use publicly-displayed, one-size-fits-all behaviour “systems” in a classroom: they encourage extrinsic rather than intrinsic motivation; they undermine a sense of community; they prevent kids from generalizing good behaviours;  but this is the biggest one, to me:

A child’s dignity, privacy, self-respect are no less real or important or valid, than mine. When I undermine a children’s privacy and dignity, I do damage to their relationships: with their peers, with me, and with themselves.

Yes, behaviour charts can create a classroom full of raised hands, quiet voices, walking feet, please-and-thank-yous.

Our whole school follows this philosophy and charts that track children are not allowed. What do you all think?

""Before I say anything else, I want you to do a little imagining with me. As you read each paragraph, I want you to REALLY work to imagine yourself in this situation, really FEEL what it would be like. I’m sure you will catch on to my metaphor pretty quickly, but stay with me. I really couldn’t think of a better way to illustrate my point:

Imagine that you have a new job. You’re VERY excited about this new job, and a little bit nervous. You know there are parts of it that you will be very good at, but there are some things that you are still working on, or that you might need support from your boss to master. It’s okay, though, because you’re pretty sure that your boss is really nice, and will help you work on those things.

You arrive at work and start meeting your new co-workers, who are just as excited and nervous as you. You notice that some of them seem to be VERY good at nearly everything, and others seem to struggle with even more things than you, but altogether they are a nice enough group and you feel like you will be a good team. You start to make some work friends. It feels good.

Then, at some point – maybe right away, maybe after a few days or weeks or months, your boss sits you ALL down together and explains a new performance management system. On the wall of your communal work area, Boss has posted a list of all the employees, by name. Next to each name is a rainbow of colour-coded cards. Boss explains that every employee will start each day on the same colour, but depending on your performance, your name can be moved up the rainbow, or down the rainbow. People who move up the rainbow will get special extras: a small bonus, or an extra long lunch, or a half-day off. People who move down the rainbow will face consequences: a shorter break, a docked paycheck, a note in their file.

This post is an honest reflection of my experience, but please note, I have found most of these generalities to be true. Also, it is important to note that I wanted to be a teacher since I was a little girl. I have a true, strong passion for teaching, which I hope puts things into perspective that the 'cons' are not just whining. 

**Background**: I have taught science, English, and I am currently teaching GATE with an emphasis on acceleration in English. I have worked with grades 6-8, and I am endorsed in science, TESOL, GATE, and English. I am almost done with my master's. I am a level II teacher in New Mexico. I will hopefully be a level 3 when I'm done with my master's. I am also a teacher leader in my school. I have had a lot of success, BUT my first year of teaching was literally the WORST year of my life. I would never want to re-live it. I also work in a title 1 school in one of the poorest districts in the country. I have experience with the best and the worst of it all. I'll start with the pros. I have been teaching middle school for 6 years, but I also have 5 years of experience at the college level (adjunct). I have 3 years of tutoring experience at the college level, as well. Oh, yes, the pros...

**Pros**

**The connection with the students:** Again and again, this rings true. If it was not for that connection, I could not stay. The students make it worth it. At the same time, there are students that can really harm your daily work life. I'll talk about that in the cons.

**It's not boring:** I do not really find monotony in my job. I have a lot of control on how interesting I can make it. I'm not sitting at a desk staring at a wall. I'm on my feet, and I enjoy making lessons I'm passionate about.

**Always learning:** Teaching forces you to become a lifelong learner. You can't get stuck (unless you really want to) in one type of mentality. You see so many perspectives, and you can take one subject or topic from many angles.

**It gets better with time**: Teaching seriously gets better with time. That's the hard part. You have to get through those first 3ish years to see its true benefits. This is my 6th year of teaching, and I can say that I have learned how to make my job a thousand times easier. My students are in control of learning. I don't go home exhausted anymore.

**There are jobs:** You really can find a teaching job most places. However, be prepared for the not-so-glamorous jobs when you first start teaching. Also, it just so happens that the worst districts need teachers (obvious, right?). That may seem bad at first glance, but I have found that I have risen to leadership positions in my district because I am not a shitty teacher. I have stuck with it, and I get more respect. 

**A certain level of independence**: Even with all the crazy evaluation systems now, there's no way you can be watched all of the time. In most districts, administrators have to put a certain trust in the fact that you are a professional. Also, I find the more you 'prove' the more you're left alone. I suffered a lot of observations and criticism in order to get to the point where I am. Again, it's the work and effort you put into in the first place. I was rated 'highly effective' (almost exemplary) in my state, so I don't have administrators breathing down my back as much. That took a lot of hard work though.

**An amazing perspective**: Teaching has taught me more about compassion, kindness, patience, love, laughter, etc. than anything ever could. I wish everybody could see through the eyes of a teacher for a day.

**Vacations**: Sure, I do work through some of my vacations, but I am not going to lie, they are amazing. Still, don't become a teacher because you want vacations. The reason why I still have good vacations is that I don't mind prepping for the next session during my breaks. I don't think any teachers truly get full vacations anymore. So, maybe 20 years ago, the vacations were a huge pro, but I think that has changed now that more is expected of teachers. For some perspective, I went to my classroom several times during winter break just to make sure I was ready for the new semester. Also, during the summer, I start really planning a month in advance before the school year starts. That usually takes a lot of hard work. I am also a bit of an “over-achiever” so that might not be what all teachers do. Do not, however, become a teacher because of vacations. It’s not worth it.

**Cons**

There are a lot of problems in modern education, and my post history is littered with those. Despite the benefits listed, the cons seem to outweigh them (in my professional opinion). Teaching is NOT for the light-hearted, and my worst year of my entire life was my first year of teaching. I honestly was suicidal, but there were other things going on in my life at the time. Please feel free to ask me what I did WRONG my first year of teaching. I will gladly share.

**Your hard work (in some ways) does not pay off**: There are no instant results in teaching. And even when you do great, your hard work is rarely noticed. Teaching is not really a respected profession anymore. So be prepared to hear a lot of criticism. I do not know about you all, but criticism is an extremely difficult part of the job. You can spend 15 hours on your lesson plans, only to hear everything you are doing wrong. The first year or so, expect to hear nothing but constant criticism. After that, be lucky if you do not hear anything! I have come to expect that praise is rare, even for the best of teachers. I enjoy not hearing from my administrators anymore. With that being said, the occasional praise from parents, students, and administrators means everything. I keep all the little notes.
 
**You will work more than 40 hours a week**: This is true, especially of newer teachers. Unfortunately, I can’t say the work load lessens as you become more experienced. However, you learn tricks, efficiency, and speed as you get better. 

**Politics**: Our current education system is completely influenced by people who seldom if ever actually visit a classroom. Funding is constantly cut. People have completely incorrect and misleading views about education. This is my personal opinion, but education is slowly being destroyed in the United States. They are moving toward privatization of education, and I believe within 20 years public education will be gone. You can think this is a good thing, but I do not believe public institutions should be corporatized. In fact, this corporatization has increased ridiculous testing, standards, and budget cuts. Don’t go into teaching thinking there are people in it for the best interest of children. I honestly believe that’s naïve. I don’t even know if all teachers are in it for the best interest of children.

**It’s a business**: Education has become a business. ‘They’ are using business models and expecting them to work in schools. They don’t. What happens with these business models is you get a high teacher turnover, ridiculous competition and standards, and students treated as numbers instead of people. In essence, it’s the “McDonaldiization of Education.""

**It’s the parents – Let me explain**: Now, don’t bash me here. I love all of my students, even the most hard to handle. However, there are a lot of issues with this generation. I’m not really hear to debate ‘but all generations suck’. Yeah, maybe just people suck. However, here are some issues, and they are all one way or another a result of bad parenting.

*There is either extreme helicopter parenting or extreme lack of parenting. There doesn’t always seem to be a balance.

*Students want to be entertained constantly.

*Parents are always right, just like the customer is always right. 

*This is definitely a ‘nobody fails’ and ‘everybody is special’ generation. It is really hard to fail students, and you have to be constantly careful of what you say/do. Anything can and will be used against you.

*Students are disrespectful to you because they are disrespectful at home.

*Students have problems in the classroom because they have problems at home.

Any issue you have with a student is almost always based on something as a result of home life. Knowing that, I have more compassion for my students before I get angry. 

**The pay**: MOST Teachers do not get paid enough for what they do. I’m not arguing this with anybody to be honest. If you want to argue, let me show you the bill for how much I pay for my own school supplies. Let me calculate the number of extra hours I work a week for nothing. Let me talk about the nights I cried when I first started teaching. Teachers should absolutely be paid more, even a little bit more!

**Unrealistic expectations**: Teachers, students, and administrators are constantly fighting unrealistic expectations. Even when you do make growth and gains with students, it usually isn’t good enough. It’s always, more, more, more. Remember, it’s a business now.

**Why am I still doing it?**

Despite the negative stuff, I have found a balance in my life and my teaching career. I have learned to ‘fight the system’ in my own classroom. I can’t control the politics. I can’t control the administration. I can’t even technically control my students (but I have learned to ‘trick them’ into learning), but I can control how I teach in my own classroom. Here are a few things that have helped me:

*I have amazing classroom management. I am willing to give any advice to any teacher on how to change the way your classroom functions. I work with some really rough students, by the way. 

*I don’t care what other teachers think of me. Teachers put each other down, and you better believe they don’t like when you’re successful. I have learned to do what I think is right, even if other teachers criticize. I can provide examples.

*I have stuck it out. I got through the pain so that I can learn from my mistakes. I also have gotten raises by fulfilling state requirements and doing really hard work.

*I am me. With pinterest and thousands of articles out there on how to be a good teacher, my best advice is to be YOU. I am a little sarcastic. I’m 5’2”, short, and bubbly. I probably look like a student. I am a girly girl. I think I have a slight lisp. My students LOVE me for who I am. I’m not going to change because pininterest told me, too. I am often shocked that students love me just as I am. They also appreciate teachers who can laugh at themselves.

*Speaking of pininterest, do not do something because it ‘looks good’. DO something because it has real research behind it.

*I don’t buy into the negativity. Teachers do complain about everything. Honestly, I can’t do it anymore. If things get that bad that I need to constantly complain, I’m changing careers.

*I don’t get lazy. This may sound rude, but a lot of teachers get lazy. It can be easy to sit at that desk and od the same old lessons. There is burnout, and I have been there. You have to find ways to overcome it. 

*I expect imperfection. I worked with a teacher who would stay 5 hours after to work to reword test questions. The students KNOW you’re human. You’re going to make mistakes. Most of the time, I’m honest with my students. “Sorry I didn’t staple these papers; I was feeling really tired. Could you guys staple them as you pick them up?” or ""Oh, did I really write that? How embarrassing!""

*I admit when I’m wrong. Nobody likes a know it all. My students have proved me wrong on many occasions. I allow RESPECTFUL debate and negotiations in my classroom. 

*I avoid work friendships. This may sound rude (again), but it just TOO much drama. I honestly leave my personal life at home. I have acquaintances, but I have made mistakes becoming too close to teachers. Teachers are often worse than students. 

*I have a life outside of teaching. I love running, photography, staying active, keeping strong in my faith, traveling, eating out, hiking, biking, learning languages, etc. I am not STOPPING my life for my job. However, I do know that I have to sacrifice some time for some sanity in my job. I go in every Sunday. It’s a sacrifice I make so that I can enjoy my week.

*I work my ass off. I put all the effort in outside of school so that my class runs smoothly when I am in school.

I hope this helped some of you get a better perspective on teaching. There are more pros/cons that can be listed, and I will add anything that you think should be added! I really am here to give you an honest perspective, and I'm also willing to give any advice.

Thanks for reading!

Any issue you have with a student is almost always based on something as a result of home life. Knowing that, I have more compassion for my students before I get angry. 

**The pay**: MOST Teachers do not get paid enough for what they do. I’m not arguing this with anybody to be honest. If you want to argue, let me show you the bill for how much I pay for my own school supplies. Let me calculate the number of extra hours I work a week for nothing. Let me talk about the nights I cried when I first started teaching. Teachers should absolutely be paid more, even a little bit more!

**Unrealistic expectations**: Teachers, students, and administrators are constantly fighting unrealistic expectations. Even when you do make growth and gains with students, it usually isn’t good enough. It’s always, more, more, more. Remember, it’s a business now.

**Why am I still doing it?**

Despite the negative stuff, I have found a balance in my life and my teaching career. I have learned to ‘fight the system’ in my own classroom. I can’t control the politics. I can’t control the administration. I can’t even technically control my students (but I have learned to ‘trick them’ into learning), but I can control how I teach in my own classroom. Here are a few things that have helped me:

*I have amazing classroom management. I am willing to give any advice to any teacher on how to change the way your classroom functions. I work with some really rough students, by the way. 

*I don’t care what other teachers think of me. Teachers put each other down, and you better believe they don’t like when you’re successful. I have learned to do what I think is right, even if other teachers criticize. I can provide examples.

*I have stuck it out. I got through the pain so that I can learn from my mistakes. I also have gotten raises by fulfilling state requirements and doing really hard work.

*I am me. With pinterest and thousands of articles out there on how to be a good teacher, my best advice is to be YOU. I am a little sarcastic. I’m 5’2”, short, and bubbly. I probably look like a student. I am a girly girl. I think I have a slight lisp. My students LOVE me for who I am. I’m not going to change because pininterest told me, too. I am often shocked that students love me just as I am. They also appreciate teachers who can laugh at themselves.

*Speaking of pininterest, do not do something because it ‘looks good’. DO something because it has real research behind it.

*I don’t buy into the negativity. Teachers do complain about everything. Honestly, I can’t do it anymore. If things get that bad that I need to constantly complain, I’m changing careers.

*I don’t get lazy. This may sound rude, but a lot of teachers get lazy. It can be easy to sit at that desk and od the same old lessons. There is burnout, and I have been there. You have to find ways to overcome it. 

*I expect imperfection. I worked with a teacher who would stay 5 hours after to work to reword test questions. The students KNOW you’re human. You’re going to make mistakes. Most of the time, I’m honest with my students. “Sorry I didn’t staple these papers; I was feeling really tired. Could you guys staple them as you pick them up?” or ""Oh, did I really write that? How embarrassing!""

*I admit when I’m wrong. Nobody likes a know it all. My students have proved me wrong on many occasions. I allow RESPECTFUL debate and negotiations in my classroom. 

*I avoid work friendships. This may sound rude (again), but it just TOO much drama. I honestly leave my personal life at home. I have acquaintances, but I have made mistakes becoming too close to teachers. Teachers are often worse than students. 

*I have a life outside of teaching. I love running, photography, staying active, keeping strong in my faith, traveling, eating out, hiking, biking, learning languages, etc. I am not STOPPING my life for my job. However, I do know that I have to sacrifice some time for some sanity in my job. I go in every Sunday. It’s a sacrifice I make so that I can enjoy my week.

*I work my ass off. I put all the effort in outside of school so that my class runs smoothly when I am in school.

I hope this helped some of you get a better perspective on teaching. There are more pros/cons that can be listed, and I will add anything that you think should be added! I really am here to give you an honest perspective, and I'm also willing to give any advice.

Thanks for reading!

Edit: Sorry for any little errors. Teaching should be capitalized in my post.

I dread each day and when I´m in class I feel this sense of dread and agony. 

A bit about my situation:

I´m a 24 year old American working as a language assistant in Spain. It´s a program through the Spanish government where you work for 12 classroom hours a week and get paid a monthly grant for basic living needs. I also have a 2nd job teaching Facebook engineers English over Skype through an American company which is great for a bit of spending money but also helping me burn out faster, but I´ll stick to talking about this actual classroom job for now. 

The classroom job is only two days a week, 7 hours per day, which doesn´t seem like a lot at all, but after 3 years of doing this, I feel like I cannot possibly continue. I only work 2 days a week because my school was nice and adapted my schedule to the long commute. I commute 4 hours a day (2 there, 2 back). 

The biggest problem with this job is that none of the schools or teachers actually follow  the contract. I´m supposed to just be a language assistant, but they treat me as if I were their slave, or a very cheap extra teacher to boss around. According to my contract, I´m legally not allowed to ever be alone with the kids, I´m not allowed to grade exams, I´m not supposed to have to plan all of the lessons... basically I´m meant to be utilized in the classroom as an assistant or a tool to provide English conversation with the kids. In other words, there should ALWAYS be the main teacher teaching in the classroom while I assist her. I do not have any teacher training. I majored in Spanish at university.

In my 3 years of doing this job I´ve had to grade exams, create exams, teach in classrooms of 25 kids completely on my own, plan daily lessons, come up with activities on the spot, etc. 
I changed to a new school this year and I only work with one teacher and it´s just... pushed me over the edge. I spend 7 hours a day taking orders from this woman while she basically spends those days taking a break. 

For example here´s how my day has gone so far:
First class was the kindergarteners. Main teacher drew ballpoint pen halloween pumpkins in their notebook and told them to  color it while I was meant to walk around and teach them the colors in English, teach them how to say different words, etc. So the main English teacher who is paid almost 4 times as much as me improvised a poorly drawn pumpkin in January and expected me to improvise a lesson out of that (to 5 year olds who don´t speak a word of English, no less). 

2nd class was with 1st graders. There´s a flu going around so only 5 kids showed up. Main teacher asked me to think of a fun game to play with them. Main teacher sat in the back of the class to grade papers while I was left in charge of the whole class with no lesson plans.

3rd class was with 3rd graders. The main teacher did activities from the workbook with the class while she sent me to the back to work with 2 students at a time (I had printed out some worksheets in preperation because she does this often). She told me I could only spend 15  minutes with each group because she wanted me to work with more students. I had to improvise a way to drastically shorten the activity.

etc, etc.

It´s like this every day. She is lazy and unprepared and expects me to come in and have amazing lessons with a ton of energy. I´m sick of it. The kids don´t speak a word of English and it´s just painful and exhausting. 

This is all AFTER I stuck up for myself and demanded they not take advantage of me so much. Before it was much worse. Before they wanted me to have a ¨story time¨ in the library every day during the break with the ¨punished students¨ where they basically  dump 20 5-10 year olds on me and leave me alone. The main teacher wanted me to work with the entire class on my own while she colored with a few in the back. So I´ve already stuck up for myself quite a bit. The problem is that it´s such a crappy program with nobody enforcing the rules, nobody in charge that cares, and the knowledge that if I quit, there are hundreds of Americans ready to take my spot.

I feel so burnt out. I have 4 months left of this school year to get through. Is this what teaching with your own classroom is like? Am I so burnt out because this is a crappy situation or because I´m not meant to be a teacher?

I think something that adds to it is the absolute disorder and chaos and low quality of the classroom. It´s obvious that the main teacher never ever plans any kind of lesson. There´s no order to anything. She randomly decides to draw a face in each student´s notebook for them to color. That´s the day´s lesson. Or she yells vocabulary words at them with no rhyme or reason. It´s chaotic and nobody learns anything ever. There´s constant shouting, no actual teaching ever (other than telling them to work in their workbooks), and it feels really.... empty.

I have 3-4 students who non stop try to get up, walk around, and just talk outloud excessively. I have called home numerous times for them and written them up.

One of the main issues however, is that administration does not want to deal with the students that I do write up. They have enough on their plates and do not want me writing referalls for each incident of these students. Calling home has done nothing to help aid the situation either (in fact it has worsened some students behavior).

The general procedures I outlined in the beginning of the year included coming to class, quietly working on the Do Now when they entered, raising their hands if they need to use the bathroom, and being generally respectful of one another (not talking when someone else is talking, etc). I do my best to make lessons interesting/do labs, but even when we do labs they are constantly off task and screaming/not completing the lab.

My current class disciplinary procedures are 
1) Name on the board.
2) Verbal Warning.
3) Call home.
4) Referral + Call Home
5) Referral, Detention, Call home.

Sadly, I can not actually give detention as only the administration can (and as I previously mentioned they do not want to be bothered quite honestly). 

Since it is a new year and we have had a week long break, I am hoping they will come back more reasonable/willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice of things I should try? I am at my wits end as the class is really a burden on my soul, and I dread entering it everyday. My high school classes on the other hand are a total joy.

Yesterday they came in trying to tell me that I've singled them out because they're gay and due to previous injustices toward LGBTQ+ people, they should not be required to do homework.

The behavior has extended to their peers as well--this group will often steal from others, lie, and cheat. In the hallways they will push over other students while screaming ""MOVE, I'M GAY!"". When written a referral for this behavior or asked about their behavior by another teacher or even the administration, the response is the same: ""I'm gay, you can't do this to me!"". 

When I ask the other teachers about what they are doing to curtail the situation I am met with sheepish looks and shoulder shrugs. One openly told me that they don't want to get involved because this is such a touchy situation, but they are noticing the same behaviors as I am.

Background:
-I'm a first year teacher
-Title I Charter School
-Middle School (6-8)
-Urban/Minority
-Long hours, tons of BS, principal resigned back in December without so much as a goodbye so that gives you some perspective

That said, I'm surviving. I really had to put on my big girl pants to get these kids under control and have some semblance of respect and understanding. I still have bad days, but these are NOT bad kids. They just don't value education and unless you have a ridged schedule, a tough pair of cojones, and a sprinkle of love they will walk all over you.

We only have 5 core teachers in the middle school but one of them has struggled since day 1. On Friday as the students were going home and I was outside my classroom I saw her sitting on the ground outside her classroom door. I knew something was up, and assumed she had a rough time. As I found out later, she had been sitting outside the classroom crying because the kids were so bad. 

She hasn't been able to accomplish anything with her students. From my understanding, she doesn't even teach. She puts her feet up on the desk until the special education teach walks in and jumps up to write something on the board. She is quiet as a mouse and has almost no personality. I stepped in one day on my prep to cover her 8th grade class as she had called off sick, and by the end of the hour the kids were asking why I wasn't THEIR math teacher (I'm ELA and Social Studies). They claim I taught them more in that entire hour than they learned in a week.

Her class is an endless cycle of rambunctious behavior. I can hear her class all the way down my hallway. When I walk by, the kids are all over the room doing absolutely nothing. This behavior then transfers to my classroom and the other middle school classrooms as well as in the hallways. We have STRUGGLED to get their behaviors under control, but I feel at this point, she undermines our hard work. It's like having a police officer watch two people beat each other but do nothing about it.

I'm tired of it. I'm sick of babysitting this teacher who is essentially collecting a paycheck. She is doing a massive disservice to our students who are already struggling in reading and math. She has completely shut down with us as well. I can only offer up so much support and advice.

Her class is an endless cycle of rambunctious behavior. I can hear her class all the way down my hallway. When I walk by, the kids are all over the room doing absolutely nothing. This behavior then transfers to my classroom and the other middle school classrooms as well as in the hallways. We have STRUGGLED to get their behaviors under control, but I feel at this point, she undermines our hard work. It's like having a police officer watch two people beat each other but do nothing about it.

I'm tired of it. I'm sick of babysitting this teacher who is essentially collecting a paycheck. She is doing a massive disservice to our students who are already struggling in reading and math. She has completely shut down with us as well. I can only offer up so much support and advice. 

Am I being insensitive? What can I do for her that can help her? Should I take this to administration? Thanks all for the insight.",487,compound,-0.6792,2017

I feel like it is rarely said but I really mean it. A couple of days ago, a teacher from our school named Mrs. Eddy passed away due to cancer. We had all known about it. Hell, when I had her for Honors English 11, she would sometimes have to miss class for chemotherapy sessions. At the beginning of the school year, she took an extended leave which turned out to be indefinite. 

The reason I say this is because Mrs. Eddy was one of the few teachers I actually gave a shit about. She was the first person to EVER care about my writing and inspired me to read and write like no other teacher did. I got back into poetry and screenplay writing because of her. 

I am not going to say that she changed my life or that she was that one teacher that inspired me to be great. That shit is for the movies. However, she was a great teacher, a wonderful person, and a kind soul.

It saddens me to think about the fact that I never got to tell her that. 

So for all the teachers out there who wake up every morning, and inspire, thank you. I know it's not easy. Teaching isn't an easy job. I couldn't do it, especially if I had cancer. 

Mrs. Eddy, my thoughts are with you tonight.

And to all other teachers, thank you for everything you do.

I siege them with questions. I hurl shot after shot into the room and latch onto what they throw back. Early in the year I’m satisfied with a couple of timid answers. After a brief statement about a birthday party or a complaint about work, I downshift and the class lurches into English mode. 

Eventually they talk back. 

**Talking Back**

The conversation becomes organic. The getting-to-know-you time (this is what I call it in my head) becomes an expected part of the lesson. Students anticipate. They no longer wait for my questions, but instead go on the offensive. Sometimes I’m flattered (when students want to know how I met my smoking hot wife). Other times I’m agitated (when students resolutely defended the stance that advertising had no effect on their lives.) Mostly, though, I enjoy a casual camaraderie with my class as I share interesting things I either know about (like the inevitable [house centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutigera_coleoptrata)), or things I’ve been thinking about (anything from the value of dogs to [why female students have better handwriting than male](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2xwhhj/why_do_girls_tend_to_have_better_handwriting_than/)). They piggyback off my stories and share experiences of their own; they piggyback off my ideas and share ideas of their own.

As the year goes on, I inevitably see students grin widely. They ask questions about things that they suspect I might want to speak at-length about. *He’s doing it again*, they think as they ask about my projects, my travel, my outfit. *We waste so much time in this class.*

And a waste of time is, in fact, what it looks like. On my bad days, I’m torn with guilt. What should have been five quick minutes turns into fifteen, and I find myself rushing through some part of the lesson to compensate. Word of my class spreads to other students, and--by proxy--to other teachers. I see knowing glances and I feel a pit in my stomach. Is this bad teaching? It feels like bad teaching.

If tasked to defend this getting-to-know-you time, say, in front of an administrator, I might speak at some length about the conversational skills it builds. Students speak about their interests, I could say. Or they are required to listen and respond thoughtfully to their peers. I could argue that I am modelling good conversation skills and hitting speaking and listening standards in the process.

All of these explanations, though, are bullshit. We talk to each other for only one reason: It makes the class a better place to be.

**Wrestling a Pig, Tug-of-War, and Other Mixed Metaphors.**

&gt; I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.

&gt; George Bernard Shaw

I’ve had classes that don’t talk. They don’t talk to one another and they don’t talk to me--not about The Odyssey and not about their lives. I’ve wrestled with these classes, and I’ve only gotten dirty (Metaphor 1).

These classes are a tug-of-war (Metaphor 2). My class and I are pulling in opposite directions and I have to fight for every inch of progress against 28 inert teenagers. If I let up, we move backwards. Nothing gets done in these classes.

A culture of conversation bends this inertia. Instead of pulling against one another, students begin to shift to my side of the mud pit. If I get enough students--or just the right students with the right pull--the momentum can swing. In the well-run classes the good guys reach a critical mass and are able to pull laggards to our side. In the best classes, all the students are on the right side of the puddle and we collectively pull against the content.

Now, I don’t want to build a strawman. Classes can fall anywhere on the spectrum between the pullers and the inert. Having a class full of pullers (read: talkers) is a problem as well. Once empowered, pullers can drift and tug in a direction all their own. If enough of these pullers drift in the right direction, they can change the direction of the class. 

But here’s the simple truth: As a teacher, I am the captain of the ship (Metaphor 3!). My students do the rowing. I can encourage, cajole, or threaten them to get them to pull their oars. I can use a carrot, or I can use a stick, but if they let their oars drag we are dead in the water. Getting students talking is getting students rowing. Some students drift and do not row to the rhythm. Others row half-heartedly. If I do my job well, though, we row to a steady beat. In the end, though, the only power I have is to point the ship in the right direction. Any momentum forward is momentum I can use. That momentum comes from the community we build as a class, and the best rowers are those students who have bought into the classroom community. This starts with talking.

**Community is Everything**

We take ownership in the communities we belong to. It’s why they are so special to us. We recognize them at once as something that are ‘ours’ and something that are larger than us. Our communities give us strength and help us grow. That’s the takeaway. This is the role of the best classrooms.

Humans are hardwired to share. We are programed to tell and listen to stories. If you don’t believe me, try an experiment: The next time you approach a group of friends milling away in conversation, tell them that you have a story to share and watch as their attention snaps to you. We’re addicted to them. Our entertainment is stories; our social life is stories. Stories build the identity of our communities and tell us important things about them. Adding our own stories shape some small corner of that community into something cozy where we can sit.

My job is to teach English to indifferent high school students. Good teachers can structure activities and muscle their classrooms into a shape that can deliver content. The best teachers, though, harness the power from their students. They simply point the ship in the right direction and let the students do the rowing.

The best classrooms are the best communities. The best communities empower their members to share, build, and make them their own.

This post is an honest reflection of my experience, but please note, I have found most of these generalities to be true. Also, it is important to note that I wanted to be a teacher since I was a little girl. I have a true, strong passion for teaching, which I hope puts things into perspective that the 'cons' are not just whining. 

**Background**: I have taught science, English, and I am currently teaching GATE with an emphasis on acceleration in English. I have worked with grades 6-8, and I am endorsed in science, TESOL, GATE, and English. I am almost done with my master's. I am a level II teacher in New Mexico. I will hopefully be a level 3 when I'm done with my master's. I am also a teacher leader in my school. I have had a lot of success, BUT my first year of teaching was literally the WORST year of my life. I would never want to re-live it. I also work in a title 1 school in one of the poorest districts in the country. I have experience with the best and the worst of it all. I'll start with the pros. I have been teaching middle school for 6 years, but I also have 5 years of experience at the college level (adjunct). I have 3 years of tutoring experience at the college level, as well. Oh, yes, the pros...

**Pros**

**The connection with the students:** Again and again, this rings true. If it was not for that connection, I could not stay. The students make it worth it. At the same time, there are students that can really harm your daily work life. I'll talk about that in the cons.

**It's not boring:** I do not really find monotony in my job. I have a lot of control on how interesting I can make it. I'm not sitting at a desk staring at a wall. I'm on my feet, and I enjoy making lessons I'm passionate about.

**Always learning:** Teaching forces you to become a lifelong learner. You can't get stuck (unless you really want to) in one type of mentality. You see so many perspectives, and you can take one subject or topic from many angles.

**It gets better with time**: Teaching seriously gets better with time. That's the hard part. You have to get through those first 3ish years to see its true benefits. This is my 6th year of teaching, and I can say that I have learned how to make my job a thousand times easier. My students are in control of learning. I don't go home exhausted anymore.

**There are jobs:** You really can find a teaching job most places. However, be prepared for the not-so-glamorous jobs when you first start teaching. Also, it just so happens that the worst districts need teachers (obvious, right?). That may seem bad at first glance, but I have found that I have risen to leadership positions in my district because I am not a shitty teacher. I have stuck with it, and I get more respect. 

**A certain level of independence**: Even with all the crazy evaluation systems now, there's no way you can be watched all of the time. In most districts, administrators have to put a certain trust in the fact that you are a professional. Also, I find the more you 'prove' the more you're left alone. I suffered a lot of observations and criticism in order to get to the point where I am. Again, it's the work and effort you put into in the first place. I was rated 'highly effective' (almost exemplary) in my state, so I don't have administrators breathing down my back as much. That took a lot of hard work though.

**An amazing perspective**: Teaching has taught me more about compassion, kindness, patience, love, laughter, etc. than anything ever could. I wish everybody could see through the eyes of a teacher for a day.

**Vacations**: Sure, I do work through some of my vacations, but I am not going to lie, they are amazing. Still, don't become a teacher because you want vacations. The reason why I still have good vacations is that I don't mind prepping for the next session during my breaks. I don't think any teachers truly get full vacations anymore. So, maybe 20 years ago, the vacations were a huge pro, but I think that has changed now that more is expected of teachers. For some perspective, I went to my classroom several times during winter break just to make sure I was ready for the new semester. Also, during the summer, I start really planning a month in advance before the school year starts. That usually takes a lot of hard work. I am also a bit of an “over-achiever” so that might not be what all teachers do. Do not, however, become a teacher because of vacations. It’s not worth it.

**Cons**

There are a lot of problems in modern education, and my post history is littered with those. Despite the benefits listed, the cons seem to outweigh them (in my professional opinion). Teaching is NOT for the light-hearted, and my worst year of my entire life was my first year of teaching. I honestly was suicidal, but there were other things going on in my life at the time. Please feel free to ask me what I did WRONG my first year of teaching. I will gladly share.

**Your hard work (in some ways) does not pay off**: There are no instant results in teaching. And even when you do great, your hard work is rarely noticed. Teaching is not really a respected profession anymore. So be prepared to hear a lot of criticism. I do not know about you all, but criticism is an extremely difficult part of the job. You can spend 15 hours on your lesson plans, only to hear everything you are doing wrong. The first year or so, expect to hear nothing but constant criticism. After that, be lucky if you do not hear anything! I have come to expect that praise is rare, even for the best of teachers. I enjoy not hearing from my administrators anymore. With that being said, the occasional praise from parents, students, and administrators means everything. I keep all the little notes.
 
**You will work more than 40 hours a week**: This is true, especially of newer teachers. Unfortunately, I can’t say the work load lessens as you become more experienced. However, you learn tricks, efficiency, and speed as you get better. 

**Politics**: Our current education system is completely influenced by people who seldom if ever actually visit a classroom. Funding is constantly cut. People have completely incorrect and misleading views about education. This is my personal opinion, but education is slowly being destroyed in the United States. They are moving toward privatization of education, and I believe within 20 years public education will be gone. You can think this is a good thing, but I do not believe public institutions should be corporatized. In fact, this corporatization has increased ridiculous testing, standards, and budget cuts. Don’t go into teaching thinking there are people in it for the best interest of children. I honestly believe that’s naïve. I don’t even know if all teachers are in it for the best interest of children.

**It’s a business**: Education has become a business. ‘They’ are using business models and expecting them to work in schools. They don’t. What happens with these business models is you get a high teacher turnover, ridiculous competition and standards, and students treated as numbers instead of people. In essence, it’s the “McDonaldiization of Education.""

**It’s the parents – Let me explain**: Now, don’t bash me here. I love all of my students, even the most hard to handle. However, there are a lot of issues with this generation. I’m not really hear to debate ‘but all generations suck’. Yeah, maybe just people suck. However, here are some issues, and they are all one way or another a result of bad parenting.

*There is either extreme helicopter parenting or extreme lack of parenting. There doesn’t always seem to be a balance.

*Students want to be entertained constantly.

*Parents are always right, just like the customer is always right. 

*This is definitely a ‘nobody fails’ and ‘everybody is special’ generation. It is really hard to fail students, and you have to be constantly careful of what you say/do. Anything can and will be used against you.

*Students are disrespectful to you because they are disrespectful at home.

*Students have problems in the classroom because they have problems at home.

Any issue you have with a student is almost always based on something as a result of home life. Knowing that, I have more compassion for my students before I get angry. 

**The pay**: MOST Teachers do not get paid enough for what they do. I’m not arguing this with anybody to be honest. If you want to argue, let me show you the bill for how much I pay for my own school supplies. Let me calculate the number of extra hours I work a week for nothing. Let me talk about the nights I cried when I first started teaching. Teachers should absolutely be paid more, even a little bit more!

**Unrealistic expectations**: Teachers, students, and administrators are constantly fighting unrealistic expectations. Even when you do make growth and gains with students, it usually isn’t good enough. It’s always, more, more, more. Remember, it’s a business now.

**Why am I still doing it?**

Despite the negative stuff, I have found a balance in my life and my teaching career. I have learned to ‘fight the system’ in my own classroom. I can’t control the politics. I can’t control the administration. I can’t even technically control my students (but I have learned to ‘trick them’ into learning), but I can control how I teach in my own classroom. Here are a few things that have helped me:

*I have amazing classroom management. I am willing to give any advice to any teacher on how to change the way your classroom functions. I work with some really rough students, by the way. 

*I don’t care what other teachers think of me. Teachers put each other down, and you better believe they don’t like when you’re successful. I have learned to do what I think is right, even if other teachers criticize. I can provide examples.

*I have stuck it out. I got through the pain so that I can learn from my mistakes. I also have gotten raises by fulfilling state requirements and doing really hard work.

*I am me. With pinterest and thousands of articles out there on how to be a good teacher, my best advice is to be YOU. I am a little sarcastic. I’m 5’2”, short, and bubbly. I probably look like a student. I am a girly girl. I think I have a slight lisp. My students LOVE me for who I am. I’m not going to change because pininterest told me, too. I am often shocked that students love me just as I am. They also appreciate teachers who can laugh at themselves.

*Speaking of pininterest, do not do something because it ‘looks good’. DO something because it has real research behind it.

*I don’t buy into the negativity. Teachers do complain about everything. Honestly, I can’t do it anymore. If things get that bad that I need to constantly complain, I’m changing careers.

*I don’t get lazy. This may sound rude, but a lot of teachers get lazy. It can be easy to sit at that desk and od the same old lessons. There is burnout, and I have been there. You have to find ways to overcome it. 

*I expect imperfection. I worked with a teacher who would stay 5 hours after to work to reword test questions. The students KNOW you’re human. You’re going to make mistakes. Most of the time, I’m honest with my students. “Sorry I didn’t staple these papers; I was feeling really tired. Could you guys staple them as you pick them up?” or ""Oh, did I really write that? How embarrassing!""

*I admit when I’m wrong. Nobody likes a know it all. My students have proved me wrong on many occasions. I allow RESPECTFUL debate and negotiations in my classroom. 

*I avoid work friendships. This may sound rude (again), but it just TOO much drama. I honestly leave my personal life at home. I have acquaintances, but I have made mistakes becoming too close to teachers. Teachers are often worse than students. 

*I have a life outside of teaching. I love running, photography, staying active, keeping strong in my faith, traveling, eating out, hiking, biking, learning languages, etc. I am not STOPPING my life for my job. However, I do know that I have to sacrifice some time for some sanity in my job. I go in every Sunday. It’s a sacrifice I make so that I can enjoy my week.

*I work my ass off. I put all the effort in outside of school so that my class runs smoothly when I am in school.

I hope this helped some of you get a better perspective on teaching. There are more pros/cons that can be listed, and I will add anything that you think should be added! I really am here to give you an honest perspective, and I'm also willing to give any advice.

Thanks for reading!

So I am a first year teacher and I have lost control of my one middle school class. I travel there from the High School where I normally teach, to teach the last period of the day (8th). The class itself is 32 students. They simply talk non stop and it is a constant struggle to have them settled down and quiet going through a lesson. I have 3-4 students who non stop try to get up, walk around, and just talk outloud excessively. I have called home numerous times for them and written them up.

One of the main issues however, is that administration does not want to deal with the students that I do write up. They have enough on their plates and do not want me writing referalls for each incident of these students. Calling home has done nothing to help aid the situation either (in fact it has worsened some students behavior).

The general procedures I outlined in the beginning of the year included coming to class, quietly working on the Do Now when they entered, raising their hands if they need to use the bathroom, and being generally respectful of one another (not talking when someone else is talking, etc). I do my best to make lessons interesting/do labs, but even when we do labs they are constantly off task and screaming/not completing the lab.

My current class disciplinary procedures are 
1) Name on the board.
2) Verbal Warning.
3) Call home.
4) Referral + Call Home
5) Referral, Detention, Call home.

Sadly, I can not actually give detention as only the administration can (and as I previously mentioned they do not want to be bothered quite honestly). 

Since it is a new year and we have had a week long break, I am hoping they will come back more reasonable/willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice of things I should try? I am at my wits end as the class is really a burden on my soul, and I dread entering it everyday. My high school classes on the other hand are a total joy.

5) Referral, Detention, Call home.

Sadly, I can not actually give detention as only the administration can (and as I previously mentioned they do not want to be bothered quite honestly). 

Since it is a new year and we have had a week long break, I am hoping they will come back more reasonable/willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice of things I should try? I am at my wits end as the class is really a burden on my soul, and I dread entering it everyday. My high school classes on the other hand are a total joy.

Thanks and happy new years to all.",508,compound,-0.3036,2017

3. Do you enjoy it? 


Context: 

23, just finished a BS in Psychology but realoze I don't want to do that type of work. I always thought teaching would be nice and ice volunteered with schools during college a bit and love kids. 

Anyway, since I didn't take the education program I have to take a program at a other school which means I'd  be going for a master's to become an elementary teacher.... With 0 previous knOwledge.

The schools around here have had elementary openings for a while and I feel like it shouldn't be hard but idk. I live in a small part of South Carolina.

Any advice ? I'm just worried because aside from teaching, I have no idea how to use my BS I have. It's useless since I'm not doing psychology after all. And I can't imagine just being a secretary or something for the amount I paid to go to school.

I had been horribly sick during November and fell behind in my grading. He graciously offered to help me through a stack of essays. 



While we were grading, we noticed my students were BOMBING it. I didn't feel good about putting these scores. I didn't feel they fully represented my students, since I'd gotten sick and hadn't been able to review their work with them for proper improvement. So, he discussed his modified ""power of zero"". I was like, oh God, not this again! I'd done power of zero and it had inflated my students grades to a point that it wasn't showing their ability.

He explained that on the AP test you only have to get 85% to get a 5.

However, he also GRADES AP style and students can excel in his class through modifying a passing test to count 85 as 100. Our really, any score that he'd like. So students can't receive a 0 if they try, but they won't receive HALF the points for a horrible attempt. They get a F, but not a soul crushing, can't pull yourself out 0 F.



I applied this concept to my essays, and then to some short answers for another class. Sucess!

I am a second year junior high spec ed teacher, who teaches mostly students with cognitive delays in a small setting (10-13 students). My management style works well in my small class, my students follow my set rules very well, and they are posted up on the wall and they see them each day coming in. I also do a positive behaviour system in which they get ""paid"" fake money for following the rules, in which they can buy class prizes.

This year, my admin gave me a mainstream class to teach. The class has 30 kids in it, and I cannot control it. It has been 4 months now, and I am struggling. 
From the beginning of the 44 minute period, the students are extremely loud and disruptive. They shout at each other, and do not seem to listen or respect when I am talking. I've had to do class detentions several times.
I've posted my rules (Mutual respect of others when they are talking, cell phones away until the break, listen when others are talking), and am firm when I explain, but they do not seem to adhere to them. Often times there are several small talks (after I finally get them winded down) while I am teaching, and students ALWAYS have their phones out. When I see a phone, I take it and give it to the office for students to collect later, which seemed to work for awhile, but many students constantly lose their phones each week. 

I can't get the small talk to stop. I've tried holding them in at their break, I do a seating plan, I've called home. I've sent students to admin, and nothing was seemed to have been done, as they were back the next day doing the same thing.

I am a second year junior high spec ed teacher, who teaches mostly students with cognitive delays in a small setting (10-13 students). My management style works well in my small class, my students follow my set rules very well, and they are posted up on the wall and they see them each day coming in. I also do a positive behaviour system in which they get ""paid"" fake money for following the rules, in which they can buy class prizes.

This year, my admin gave me a mainstream class to teach. The class has 30 kids in it, and I cannot control it. It has been 4 months now, and I am struggling. 
From the beginning of the 44 minute period, the students are extremely loud and disruptive. They shout at each other, and do not seem to listen or respect when I am talking. I've had to do class detentions several times.
I've posted my rules (Mutual respect of others when they are talking, cell phones away until the break, listen when others are talking), and am firm when I explain, but they do not seem to adhere to them. Often times there are several small talks (after I finally get them winded down) while I am teaching, and students ALWAYS have their phones out. When I see a phone, I take it and give it to the office for students to collect later, which seemed to work for awhile, but many students constantly lose their phones each week. 

I can't get the small talk to stop. I've tried holding them in at their break, I do a seating plan, I've called home. I've sent students to admin, and nothing was seemed to have been done, as they were back the next day doing the same thing. 

Sorry for this long winded post, I know it could be more articulate, but I am a little flustered right now. If anyone would have any classroom management advice for this, it would be greatly appreciated! ",535,compound,0.3914,2017

The downside to this is I have five preps and barely feel like I have time to do two of them well at all. I teach mostly EBD students, though my caseload has almost no overlap with the students I see in classes. 


Today was our first day back from break, and I just DID NOT want to go back. Starting off the day with a hour long faculty meeting did not help, nor did the one and a half hour long department meeting following it. By the one hour mark of my department meeting I just asked if we could hurry this along, as the agenda was only 8 points long, and the last was about time management ffs. Well I got some push back from leadership about that. It's a common complaint, but following that meeting I had two and a half hours of actual 'planning' for the semester before I had to go to another meeting from 1 pm to 4 pm. So from 8-4 I actually only had two and half hours of actual planning time. This is where my problems begin.


I have a student who is under medical care for psychosis and is really having some issues. Her mother apparently spent the break hunting for my cell number, as she called everyone in the department whose number she could find. So I call the Mom back... there goes an hour in 'my child is having mental issues, please make them magically fixed'. Fuck. Then I need to actually plan for five classes for the next two weeks - I have an hour and a half left before I go to my training and have to submit lesson plans by end of day, so I end up spending money on teachers pay teachers for one of the classes, plan two, and tell my co-teacher's they are on their own for the last two. Fuck. 

To put a shit cherry on the shit pie I find out that county office is doing an audit of our data files. For those of you not in special ed:students in special ed all have individual goals, which are to be tracked and measured to completion with evidence. Well if Billy has a goal that says something like ""Will achieve mastery of two step equations at 80% accuracy, independently"" you need math worksheets/ ect. to show how he is progressing toward that goal.

 Well, we aren't given any time to do that, and likely don't have Billy in our classes, he's just on our ""caseload"". So we ring up Billy's teacher and ask how often he's getting 2 step equations right on tests - the teacher gives us a verbal answer, and that goes into the records. Well, that's a pretty shitty way of doing things, but when each kid has 4-16 goals and you have 12-20 kids on your 'caseload', along with preparing for your own classes, and doing the federally required paperwork, data files are one of the first things to fall by the wayside. 

So some kid in a middle school was bombing his classes, his parent's wanted him moved to self-contained special education classes and all his teachers said no, you're kid is just a lazy little shit. When the parents heard that (well, the professional version of that) they flipped their shit. They got a lawyer, the lawyer asked for the data the decision was based on and ..... drum roll..... there wasn't any fucking hard data. So the kid got moved where the parents wanted him in exchange for not suing the shit out of the school. Now they are going through every single data file looking for evidence for all these goals going back to the beginning of the school year. Oh, and goals are to be tracked every 3 weeks, by at least 3 pieces of data. So for each goal we are supposed to have 18 work samples times the number of goals the kid has. Needless to say, I have... 1-5? because there isn't time in my day to run to every fucking teacher in the school and ask them to dig through their empire of dirt to find student work samples. 

Also, I work at a HUGE school, we have nearly 200 teachers, and the campus takes 15 min. to walk across. So no, I don't have time during my 3-4 plannings a week (Because of IEP meetings and PLC meeting and department meetings and meetings about planning to have meetings) to visit every fucking teacher and beg them in the middle of their class to find work for one of 'my' kids.

Most of my high school teachers whom I spoke with said that they did not enjoy or get much out of their education classes.

So I guess I'm just looking for advice at a time when I can still influence the course of my education at a minimum of cost. If you could do it over, would you get a bachelor's in education?

I am currently in a long term sub job.  Started the Monday before Christmas break, and goes until the beginning of April.  For the most part, my classes are great.  However, I am struggling with my sixth hour class.

I know part of the problem is that it is sixth hour, and they are ready to go home.  However, I still have to teach them...

There isn't one behavior, or one person in the class, that is causing me problems.

Peer pressure from other students doesn't seem to work with this group.  

I went to the assistant principal with my concerns after the second day, and he looked at the roster - he mentioned about seven kids that he named the ""worst of the seventh grade class"" this year -- and they are all together in my sixth hour.  He decided to write up a behavior contract.  We presented it to the students together.  It worked for that day... but the next they were starting to revert back to their previous behavior.  (Part of this could be the fact that it was the day before break, however.)

At this point, I want to get this behavior corrected this week when we go back.  I know they know how to behave, but I just need different strategies than I know of as a newly graduated teacher to help them succeed.

I'm a college student working towards becoming a middle school social studies teacher. My main concerns are finding a job as a middle school social studies teacher who never planned on coaching sports in school and supporting a family.

A little background:

I am a junior in college in Brooklyn, NY. I finished 2 years of nonsense classes at a community college and now it's just history and ed classes until graduation. I know a few principals locally and figured that may give me an edge for future employment, but am realizing that it may mean nothing if it's true that principals really receive what I found out to be ""hundreds of applications."" That's just staggering and very discouraging.

This sub, along with r/teaching, scares the absolute shit out of me. I know it's almost the middle of the year, teachers are now just finishing their break, and some of the members of the sub are seasoned veterans and therefore are perhaps fed up with the career, but what gives? Does teaching suck? Should I get out while I still have the chance?

I don't plan on being rich. I figured that since I live in NYC and would prob work in NYC, my starting salary will be around 54k with the new contract. I have a girlfriend who will probably be my wife in the future and she will also work, but won't make too much money (maybe 18-25k) because she's a hair and makeup stylist. I just want to know if teaching is as shitty as people make it seem to be. I do like kids and I do want to motivate them, but not at the cost of living paycheck to paycheck. Excuse my language, but fuck that. Maybe I'm not as noble as others. I don't need to be a millionaire, but I would like to live fairly comfortable and go on maybe 1-2 vacations per year and not work in the summer. It doesn't seem that unrealistic when I look online at how much teachers get paid in NYC, however the sub makes that look like an anomaly. 

Thank you all, have a happy New Year, and good luck tomorrow at your day back!

I was taught history front to back starting at the beginning of the timeline and going all the way to the end. Its the best way in my mind to make sense of what is happening, what the changes were, how things impacted each other and to grasp why history is important.
But my Principal is wanting us to just focus on the standards and show every week that they have met the standards even if that means slowing down and not teaching everything. But if I only make it to say WW2 then thats 70 years that they won't learn about. And honestly their are some of those 70 years that are more important/relevant than the last 100. And as a first year teacher it seems daunting to try and rewrite my entire lesson plans in the middle of the year to meet a style of teaching that I'm unfamiliar with and unsure if it would best benefit the students.
Which sounds easy but right now I have 71 minute classes which would be incredible...if i didn't have at least two and sometimes three different subjects in each class. This already makes me feel rushed and like I can't give all the kids the attention they deserve for that topic because I can only spend a half or a quarter of that class on group lecture before sending them off to do work while I do lecture with the other group.
Right now my class looks like this. Whole class watches CNN Student news and does daily journal then Group A will do Lecture/discussion while group B does work then they will switch half way though. So I have 30 min to teach one subject before having to move on. Thats not to mention the fact that i have to stop and help group B or deal with behavior issues (my school is a small academy that deals with behavior and emotional problems)
And my principle keeps pushing for making everything into one or two large groups but using this week as an example I'm not sure how to combine the state government with ancient south american tribes with state history about the federalist era. I'm just not sure how to make a Standards based curriculum and make sure the kids know everything they need to know and how it connects and why its important.

Its the best way in my mind to make sense of what is happening, what the changes were, how things impacted each other and to grasp why history is important.
But my Principal is wanting us to just focus on the standards and show every week that they have met the standards even if that means slowing down and not teaching everything. But if I only make it to say WW2 then thats 70 years that they won't learn about. And honestly their are some of those 70 years that are more important/relevant than the last 100. And as a first year teacher it seems daunting to try and rewrite my entire lesson plans in the middle of the year to meet a style of teaching that I'm unfamiliar with and unsure if it would best benefit the students.
Which sounds easy but right now I have 71 minute classes which would be incredible...if i didn't have at least two and sometimes three different subjects in each class. This already makes me feel rushed and like I can't give all the kids the attention they deserve for that topic because I can only spend a half or a quarter of that class on group lecture before sending them off to do work while I do lecture with the other group.
Right now my class looks like this. Whole class watches CNN Student news and does daily journal then Group A will do Lecture/discussion while group B does work then they will switch half way though. So I have 30 min to teach one subject before having to move on. Thats not to mention the fact that i have to stop and help group B or deal with behavior issues (my school is a small academy that deals with behavior and emotional problems)
And my principle keeps pushing for making everything into one or two large groups but using this week as an example I'm not sure how to combine the state government with ancient south american tribes with state history about the federalist era. I'm just not sure how to make a Standards based curriculum and make sure the kids know everything they need to know and how it connects and why its important.

I am in my second year. 

We have our midterms coming up in two weeks and this week, after break, is traditionally used for mostly review in our classes. Earlier today, my principal emailed and asked if I would be willing to speak at our faculty meeting this week on best practice for midterm review. 

I'm flattered that he thought to ask me, but also feel fairly unsure of myself being such a new teacher (there are first year teachers this year, but many veteran teachers as well).

I would like to present something new and interesting-- preferably something that is tech-based since we are 1:1 iPad and put a fairly strong focus on that in our PD. 

So, what I actually do for test review is the following:
1) Provide a detailed study-guide (I believe transparency is important) 
2) Allow students to choose the method they like to review: group games? Socrative? Kahoot? etc.
3) Spend a day (or two for exams) using Socrative or Kahoot for a classroom review.
4) Send said review to students after class for further review, if they wish to use it.

While I love Socrative and Kahoot, it is fairly standard at our school and I believe most, if not all, teachers already utilize one or the other. 

Does anyone know of anything (apps, lessons, games, websites, etc.) that I could share or speak on that would be more innovative and interesting, but still helpful for other teachers?

Thank you all!

EDIT: I do just want to reinforce that, yes, I am a little insecure about my short experience of only two years.

So I am a first year teacher and I have lost control of my one middle school class. I travel there from the High School where I normally teach, to teach the last period of the day (8th). The class itself is 32 students. They simply talk non stop and it is a constant struggle to have them settled down and quiet going through a lesson. I have 3-4 students who non stop try to get up, walk around, and just talk outloud excessively. I have called home numerous times for them and written them up.

One of the main issues however, is that administration does not want to deal with the students that I do write up. They have enough on their plates and do not want me writing referalls for each incident of these students. Calling home has done nothing to help aid the situation either (in fact it has worsened some students behavior).

The general procedures I outlined in the beginning of the year included coming to class, quietly working on the Do Now when they entered, raising their hands if they need to use the bathroom, and being generally respectful of one another (not talking when someone else is talking, etc). I do my best to make lessons interesting/do labs, but even when we do labs they are constantly off task and screaming/not completing the lab.

My current class disciplinary procedures are 
1) Name on the board.
2) Verbal Warning.
3) Call home.
4) Referral + Call Home
5) Referral, Detention, Call home.

Sadly, I can not actually give detention as only the administration can (and as I previously mentioned they do not want to be bothered quite honestly). 

Since it is a new year and we have had a week long break, I am hoping they will come back more reasonable/willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice of things I should try? I am at my wits end as the class is really a burden on my soul, and I dread entering it everyday. My high school classes on the other hand are a total joy.

Thanks and happy new years to all.",False,False,Teachers,t5_2qqcs,,self,Lost Control of middle School Class: Need Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/5lk43z/lost_control_of_middle_school_class_need_help/,1483360824.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-01-02 07:40:24+00:00,"Lost Control of middle School Class: Need HelpHello,

3. Do you enjoy it?

Any advice ? I'm just worried because aside from teaching, I have no idea how to use my BS I have. It's useless since I'm not doing psychology after all. And I can't imagine just being a secretary or something for the amount I paid to go to school.

I work in a school that is most definitely not a fit for everyone.  It's not necessarily a rough school, but it drains you physically and emotionally. 

We had two teachers resign right before break.  They just couldn't handle the stress and it was really affecting their quality of life.  Interviews have been taking place and I think replacements have been selected.  They'll start their new positions this week by shadowing the former teachers, then take over once the next quarter starts next week.

I work in a school that is most definitely not a fit for everyone.  It's not necessarily a rough school, but it drains you physically and emotionally. 

We had two teachers resign right before break.  They just couldn't handle the stress and it was really affecting their quality of life.  Interviews have been taking place and I think replacements have been selected.  They'll start their new positions this week by shadowing the former teachers, then take over once the next quarter starts next week.

I am currently in a long term sub job.  Started the Monday before Christmas break, and goes until the beginning of April.  For the most part, my classes are great.  However, I am struggling with my sixth hour class.

I know part of the problem is that it is sixth hour, and they are ready to go home.  However, I still have to teach them...

There isn't one behavior, or one person in the class, that is causing me problems.

I went to the assistant principal with my concerns after the second day, and he looked at the roster - he mentioned about seven kids that he named the ""worst of the seventh grade class"" this year -- and they are all together in my sixth hour.  He decided to write up a behavior contract.  We presented it to the students together.  It worked for that day... but the next they were starting to revert back to their previous behavior.  (Part of this could be the fact that it was the day before break, however.)

At this point, I want to get this behavior corrected this week when we go back.  I know they know how to behave, but I just need different strategies than I know of as a newly graduated teacher to help them succeed.

I am in my second year. 

We have our midterms coming up in two weeks and this week, after break, is traditionally used for mostly review in our classes. Earlier today, my principal emailed and asked if I would be willing to speak at our faculty meeting this week on best practice for midterm review. 

I'm flattered that he thought to ask me, but also feel fairly unsure of myself being such a new teacher (there are first year teachers this year, but many veteran teachers as well).

I would like to present something new and interesting-- preferably something that is tech-based since we are 1:1 iPad and put a fairly strong focus on that in our PD. 

So, what I actually do for test review is the following:
1) Provide a detailed study-guide (I believe transparency is important) 
2) Allow students to choose the method they like to review: group games? Socrative? Kahoot? etc.
3) Spend a day (or two for exams) using Socrative or Kahoot for a classroom review.
4) Send said review to students after class for further review, if they wish to use it.

While I love Socrative and Kahoot, it is fairly standard at our school and I believe most, if not all, teachers already utilize one or the other. 

Does anyone know of anything (apps, lessons, games, websites, etc.) that I could share or speak on that would be more innovative and interesting, but still helpful for other teachers?

Thank you all!

EDIT: I do just want to reinforce that, yes, I am a little insecure about my short experience of only two years.

I never recited it in high school and always got the side eye from my teachers and got privileges taken away. I was fine with it. My principal gave me a dirty look at graduation for not reciting AND not singing the Star Spangled Banner (a racist anthem btw) while standing in the front row (not by choice, I'm 5'1). I could handle that much.

The thing is, I want to be a teacher. I'm currently studying to teach pre-k to third grade. This is a question to teachers who either don't believe im the pledge for whatever reason or know other teachers who don't. Do you (they) recite it with the students? Just stand for it?

So my whole stance on our pledge is that I think it's inaccurate and refuse to recite it. My personal opinion is that in the United States, we don't have liberty and justice for all. I never recited it in high school and always got the side eye from my teachers and got privileges taken away. I was fine with it. My principal gave me a dirty look at graduation for not reciting AND not singing the Star Spangled Banner (a racist anthem btw) while standing in the front row (not by choice, I'm 5'1). I could handle that much.

The thing is, I want to be a teacher. I'm currently studying to teach pre-k to third grade. This is a question to teachers who either don't believe im the pledge for whatever reason or know other teachers who don't. Do you (they) recite it with the students? Just stand for it?

So I am a first year teacher and I have lost control of my one middle school class. I travel there from the High School where I normally teach, to teach the last period of the day (8th). The class itself is 32 students. They simply talk non stop and it is a constant struggle to have them settled down and quiet going through a lesson. I have 3-4 students who non stop try to get up, walk around, and just talk outloud excessively. I have called home numerous times for them and written them up.

One of the main issues however, is that administration does not want to deal with the students that I do write up. They have enough on their plates and do not want me writing referalls for each incident of these students. Calling home has done nothing to help aid the situation either (in fact it has worsened some students behavior).

The general procedures I outlined in the beginning of the year included coming to class, quietly working on the Do Now when they entered, raising their hands if they need to use the bathroom, and being generally respectful of one another (not talking when someone else is talking, etc). I do my best to make lessons interesting/do labs, but even when we do labs they are constantly off task and screaming/not completing the lab.

My current class disciplinary procedures are 
1) Name on the board.
2) Verbal Warning.
3) Call home.
4) Referral + Call Home
5) Referral, Detention, Call home.

Sadly, I can not actually give detention as only the administration can (and as I previously mentioned they do not want to be bothered quite honestly). 

Since it is a new year and we have had a week long break, I am hoping they will come back more reasonable/willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice of things I should try? I am at my wits end as the class is really a burden on my soul, and I dread entering it everyday. My high school classes on the other hand are a total joy.

Essentially my main questions are:

1. Is getting a job really hard? 
2. Would a MA help prepare if I've never taken an education course ? 
3. Do you enjoy it? 


Context: 

23, just finished a BS in Psychology but realoze I don't want to do that type of work. I always thought teaching would be nice and ice volunteered with schools during college a bit and love kids. 

Anyway, since I didn't take the education program I have to take a program at a other school which means I'd  be going for a master's to become an elementary teacher.... With 0 previous knOwledge. 

I'm very worried since teaching is now my back up plan. I literally have no idea how to teach technically, and I've read online that getting a job is extremely hard unless you know someone. I've already applied as a teaching assistant but never even get interviews so I'm worried it'll be the same with a real position. The schools around here have had elementary openings for a while and I feel like it shouldn't be hard but idk. I live in a small part of South Carolina.

Any advice ? I'm just worried because aside from teaching, I have no idea how to use my BS I have. It's useless since I'm not doing psychology after all. And I can't imagine just being a secretary or something for the amount I paid to go to school. 

I LOVE technology also but have no idea how I could be a tech teacher like I had growing  up.

Essentially my main questions are:

1. Is getting a job really hard? 
2. Would a MA help prepare if I've never taken an education course ? 
3. Do you enjoy it? 


Context: 

23, just finished a BS in Psychology but realoze I don't want to do that type of work. I always thought teaching would be nice and ice volunteered with schools during college a bit and love kids. 

Anyway, since I didn't take the education program I have to take a program at a other school which means I'd  be going for a master's to become an elementary teacher.... With 0 previous knOwledge. 

I'm very worried since teaching is now my back up plan. I literally have no idea how to teach technically, and I've read online that getting a job is extremely hard unless you know someone. I've already applied as a teaching assistant but never even get interviews so I'm worried it'll be the same with a real position. The schools around here have had elementary openings for a while and I feel like it shouldn't be hard but idk. I live in a small part of South Carolina.

Any advice ? I'm just worried because aside from teaching, I have no idea how to use my BS I have. It's useless since I'm not doing psychology after all. And I can't imagine just being a secretary or something for the amount I paid to go to school. 

I LOVE technology also but have no idea how I could be a tech teacher like I had growing  up.
